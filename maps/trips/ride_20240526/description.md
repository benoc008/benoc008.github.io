(Writing months later...)

I wanted to do a long ride on the weekend and when my friends asked me if I want to join a 200km double pass day, I couldn't resist.  
I knew it was a long day, so to make it comfy I took the old Canyon, with a frame bag, so I have enough space for layers and extra food.  
The original plan was to meet in Glarus, and go there by train, but I was too eager to take the train in the morning, so instead I hopped on my bike a bit earlier (5:50AM) and planned to use the first 70km as a warm up.

It was chilly but beautiful, such a quiet morning, no cars, no traffic, just the empty roads and some mist in the air. The only person I met was a French guy who wanted to put a Zurichsee loop in his legs before his kids woke up. We chatted for a bit and drafted on each other before saying good bye in Rapperswil, where I continued my way towards Glarus.
I really like riding alone, no stress no rush, just me and my bike and the endless roads. Even though this time I knew I had to make it there before 8:30 or so, I wasn't worried, I knew I can do it. The pace with the guy in the beginning was also pretty good, I even took a little pee and nutri break after Rappi.

Unfortunately after the Obersee it got pretty windy and I had to dig really deep to make it there on time. I believe I did, but the train station at the meeting point was a bit off of the road, and when I got there, the others were already away. I think I've seen them just across the corner, but they didn't wait and just left.  
Except for Andras, he was also late, nut much, just like 10m, so I was happy to wait for him and catch the rest of the group together. He paced a pretty hard tempo at the beginning, and up the Klausenpass. After the headwind and this effort, I was really feeling it in my legs, even a bit of unusual tiredness, so I remember I had to ask him to take it back a little.
We didn't have to hold ourselves for long before we found the 1st contendant on the way up, and a few minutes later the second. The others were already on the top - getting cold, so we only caught them when they turned around to come back for us.
We took a minute of brake to change some layers, and then they took off like a rocket. I felt that I have to take it a bit easier, so I gave myself some time to enjoy the views. It was crazy, almost June and still snow everywhere. More and more and more snow. Near the peak I noticed a bunch of skiers (ski tourers), and the restaurant on the top was the craziest view: 
Cyclists and skiers taking a break together, haha!

We were obviously cold up there, and also knew that we have more than 150km with another mountain pass ahead of us, so after eating a little we put on all of our layers and stuffed some newspaper under our shirts and then just sent it down.

Next up: Oberalppass. 

The road that leads up to Andermatt from the North is one of my all time favorite bike teasers. Those views, those villages, the little streams, bridges and most importantly, all the climbs that start there or around there! Such a beautiful place, and we had such a beautiful weather as well. Clearly breathtaking!
In Erstfeld we took a little break again to remove the layers and refill the bottles. I'm not entirely sure why, but R decided to turn on the engines once more and paced an almost 40km/h average for the next 10km. If I wasn't completely burnt by this point, now I was, I just couldn't hold his wheels after this anymore, and we got dropped with B. 
I honestly don't mind it, we had a really nice chat for the next almost whole hour as we kept climbing towards GÃ¶schenen. He decided there that it was enough for him and opted for the train instead. 
I really wanted to finish the ride though, so I texted the others if they were still around and luckily they took a Pizza break in Andermatt. That means I was only some 6km behind, (and 350m elevation), so knowing there was nothing further ado, I kept pushing it. It wasn't that hard, it was my favorite part of the route.
Done and dusted, I made it to the pizza place, where they already had 2 slices ready for me. I chugged a coke and we slowly headed out to tackle the last bit of climb: Oberalppass.  


The beginning felt really hard, but I got in the mood and finished the climb strong. We didn't spend much time there though, it was really cold and started raining as well, so after a couple of mandatory selfies with the sign we tried racing with the rain down. Beautiful.

The end goal for the day was Chur, where we planned to take the train back. The descent on this side is long and gradual, so usually it is easy to keep a good pace down, this time however my legs were completely empty, i was just dragging myself forward and around Ilanz the group dropped me.
Luckily Andras was kind enough to wait for me and we moved together to the end.  
But the end didn't want to come, it felt further and further away, and we saw on the GPS that there are still 300m of climbing left that none of us wanted to tackle.

We desperately tried re-planning the routes to find an alternative. We finally managed! His gps showed 100m! Perfect! 
Unfortunately we learnt that it was the same route, his GPS just stopped recognizing the climbs as climbs. :sweat_smile:
But eventually we made it to Chur around 8pm. We could have made it to the train. Actually we even seen the train, with the others sitting in it, but we had no dinner yet, and we knew that the stores will be closed by the time we get home, so we really had to buy some stuff there.
Oh well, we managed. :shrug:

The next day I finally understood why I was so dead: by the afternoon I developed a high fever and felt like shit. Probably there was a virus in me already. Bad timing, since I was moving that day, what a nightmare!
Anyways, the route was beautiful as always, can only recommend! Cheers!
