The road on the Schwyz side of the Pragelpass is finally renovated! :partying_face:

I was supposed to run a trail race with Attila and Balazs in Davos, which I was quite excited about, but my knee was bothering me for a few weeks at this point and I didn't want to risk a (more serious) injury, so - as a healthy adult would do - I skipped the race.

The weather was beautiful however and I didn't want to waste it sitting home all day, so I decided to go for a bike ride instead.

I've done this side of the Pragelpass before, and that was one of the most challenging rides I've done that far. I knew I was in a much better shape, but to be honest, this climb - especially the first few km - is still a killer one.
I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the views and racing the horse girls.
