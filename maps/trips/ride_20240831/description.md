### To the start line
The day for the race I was the most afraid of for the year has come. I wouldn't even really consider it as a race, it was really for completing rather than competing for me.

200km with 7000m elevation was waiting for me, with a 6:00 start, still in the dark.

But let's not rush that much forward, because the day started already in the previous evening. We left with a car with Andras and B just after work, but due to unexpectedly heavy traffic, we could only make it there late at night.  
We were hungry, and we still had to prepare the bikes. And bike preparation is somehow never as smooth as we expect it. Luckily the others picked up our race numbers for us.

We carried the bikes on the top of the car, which unfortunately often results in dirt and dust getting stuck into places where they don't belong.  
At the beginning I considered myself lucky, as I just had to put my wheels and stuff back, re-oiled my chains and everything seemed to be as smooth as it should be.  
Andras however got something on his brakes, because it just kept rubbing and rubbing. The most annoying issue, especially with new pads. There is so little space to be aligned and every small little dent in the disc or dirt/dust stuck there can make it feel miserable.  
It doesn't just sound bad, but knowing that there is 10+ hours of riding waiting ahead with rubbing brakes slowing you down is terrible.  
Anyways, I prepared my drinks, my snacks, the GPS and lights were charged, little saddle bag with spare tubes and tools prepared, nutri bag was full and I was ready to sleep.

It wasn't easy, even though I got to bed after midnight. I was quite nervous, and there was a reason for that.  
For one, I never rode this much elevation in a day before. And for two, well, I wasn't prepared for it either. Not in terms of my fitness, nor the bicycle.
As you have probably guessed, I decided to attempt this challenge on my Aero road bike. Certainly not made for this kind of ride. It is a fair bit heavier than a regular climbing bike, it has heavy, deep wheels, which might help on the descents but definitely not uphill, and in case of a windy weather, it will be a pain too.
The other thing about it is the geometry, it is really aggressive, people asked me before if I was crazy for doing long rides on it. To be honest, that's the least of my issues, I find it pretty comfy.

The morning has come and B was kind enough to drive us down to the start line, so we didn't have to ride a few extra kms in the cold and dark village.
We were almost out of time, had to rush to put the bikes together again, quick bio brake, we dropped the backpacks and joined the start line just 2 minutes to spare before the gun.

### 3, 2, 1 Go

The vibes were incredible, loud music was playing, red lights, smoke machine and the little devil mascot, I really enjoyed it.

The first 4km was neutralised, we were riding out of the town slowly. Another factor of my unpreparedness was that I was wearing my sunglasses in the dark. Not just to be super cool, but mostly because they are with correction lenses, and I don't see anything without them.
The bunch was kind of packed, so as Andras and N were finding ways for themselves to get further, I already lost them in the first minutes. I didn't want to risk a crash at the beginning, just because I couldn't see shit.

A few minutes in however I noticed that I was really stuck with some slow fatties. I was really confused, how do they plan to finish this crazy race if they are struggling on the first little inclines.
Anyways, when I realized that I'm way behind, I kept pacing a bit and managed to overtake a good couple of people, until I finally settled in a group with people mostly riding in my speed. I was looking around, and have seen guys my age, but also much older, and some girls too.

I was a little bit afraid of the first climb explicitly, because I've seen on the race map that there will be a gravel section on the top of it. I really dislike gravel. But as I got there, it wasn't actually that terrible. Not pleasant, and I took it super careful, but still.  
A couple of people overtook me on the gravel, and consecutively on the descent as well. I managed to catch some guys and then some even faster ones cought me.

I remember one guy who's brakes were so loud, they made me scared. I called them the brakes of death in my head. I remember I was so happy that noise of hell didn't come from my bike.

When we got down to the valley again, there was the first refreshment point. I knew that the day will be long, so I decided to take a little brake to check the snack situation and pee real quick.
Many people didn't stop there, so I lost the bunch that was with me on the top, but I thought maybe I'll be able to catch them later. (I didn't.)  

After a short flat section - where my aero bike finally excelled - we were climbing again. The sun was still just coming up, the views were great, but the climb pro on my garmin - as always - made me feel unpleasant. 1000m climbing done, 6000m left. Damn.

I knew I have to take it easy if I want to finish, so I found a group that had a not too crazy pace and started chatting with them. Funny enough the guy with the screaming brakes were there too. He said that he took it to a service multiple times, and the mechanic said that everything is fine, some brakes are just like that...  
Hard to believe, but I was happy it's not mine.

Most guys around me were 50-60 year olds, from Germany and Belgium, nice people, but I moderately felt the pressure that as someone half their age, I really should go faster. So when I accidentally dropped them on a steeper section near the top, I didn't wait for them to catch me again.  
From this point on, I was riding alone for the rest of the day.

Things quickly started becoming blurry. Climbing climbing climbing, descending descending descending, then climbing again and on repeat. I took some nutri brakes whenever I could, but I remember it wasn't the good old energy bars and gels that I'm used to, but mostly cookies and chips, which I wasn't really happy about.

The only thing that broke my monotonous ride was that as I jinxed the screaming brakes of the guy, mine started doing the same. It was really worrying, but there wasn't much I could do about it there. I stopped a few times to check and they seemed to be all right from the outside, so I knew that in any case, I still have enough in them to finish the day. Or at least I hoped. But the sound was honestly becoming ridiculous.

Near 4/5 of the ride there was a pasta stop. Oh my god, the best pasta of my life. There I took a longer break and seen on my phone that N already finished the race. OMG, I still had like 2 hours of riding to go. The last kms were pretty painful, the watts that my bike computers were showing me were shamefully low, I was sure it was broken, but probably it wasn't. I was broken.

I finally made it! Look at the sweaty salts on my jersey haha! It was an incredibly tough day, but I made it in 12:05 which means that this was my longest activity this year - longer than my 12:01 Ironman.
