(Writing the entry months later.)  
Oh boy did we not expect this much snow when we started riding.  
It was end of April, almost May and as sunny as it gets. The morning was chilly and honestly, we didn't plan much. I was pacing my then new bike quite fast to warm up to the meeting point. I had to wait there for a minute, so I went to the pronto at the train station for a warm coffee (and some warm air). I didn't have to wait for long for the relief, as soon as Andras arrived, we tried getting over the hill in Thalwil, but to give it a twist: without following what our GPS said.  
We quickly found orselves on closed, one way and 30% steep roads. I didn't know those things existed around here, good I got used to them in Madeira. :sweat_smile: 

Otherwise beautiful ride, just look at these pictures!
