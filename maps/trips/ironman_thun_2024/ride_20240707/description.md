Getting out of the water was a big relief. I did one olympic triathlon before, but otherwise I've only really seen this on Youtube. People running to their bikes, removing half of their wetsuit on the way already, swim cap and goggles in the hand, there is no time for socks, just putting the helmet on and running out with the bike already.

Well, here it was not the case. I was still a little bit dizzy from the weaves and the cold, and also from laying for the past 1.5h, but after a few steps I felt like I should run.
Looking around however I only saw completely white faces, people either shivering or being on the verge of passing out.
In the refreshment station instead of iso or coke or redbull we got warm soup - which felt great but wasn't exactly what I expected when I imagined my first Ironman.

I slowly drank 2 cups of soup as I walked to the transition bags. I'm a beginner, I didn't want to pee in my wetsuit, so before changing I went to the toilette.
And then I was just sitting on the bench for 5 minutes. There was no running to the bike, no race situation. Not just me, no one.
I wasn't there to compete, just to complete, and I knew that my chances are better if I give myself another few minutes.
I was munching on my potatoes and my butter-honey sandwich, contemplating my life decisions, shivering with my wetsuit still on.
After a few minutes of this, I finally removed my wetsuit and tried tapping myself dry with my towel - until I realized I was stupid. It was still raining, I can't dry myself in the rain.
So I just took my aero socks, cycling shoes, gloves and the only jacket I had with me and walked over to my bike. On my wey out I've noticed some shivering people, being covered in rescue blankets.  
Awesome - I thought - I could use one of those! I jammed one under my jacket for some extra insulation, tapped down as strong as I could, because the referees told me it would otherwise give me an aero advantage (lol) and I hopped on the bike finally.

I wanted to start strong, just to warm up, but then I was hesitant, I knew I shouldn't burn myself out so early of the day. And also, all the other people around me were really slow, I felt like I was missing something.
A few minutes later I realised that I was simply near the very last of the swimmers, so the others might simply be weak on the bike as well, and then I finally started overtaking the crowsd.
It was a great feeling, the best part about being a bad swimmer, I can overtake so many people on the bike!

Exiting the city I finally noticed Attila and Lili as they were worryingly trying to contact some emergency services. I spent so much time in T1, they thought I already gave up, lol. They should know me better, when it comes to physical pain, I never give up. [I love pain.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb5GC-bUuZM)

As I warmed up, my next challenge was braking. I knew that the first half is mostly uphill, but I watched the course video, I knew that there will be some steep and sharp turns as well. Would be awesome to be able to use the brakes. However on the first few tries the carbon rim brakes did absolutely nothing. I didn't even slow down.
Luckily a bit later the rain stopped and as my wheels warmed up / dried a little, my brakes also started doing something.
Another challenge was the nutrition. I did some running races before, but nothing on the bike so far where I had to grab everything without stopping. I didn't know if I could manage, so on the first stop I reached for a bottle even though mine was still full.
The helpers were really good handing out the stuff, so I managed grabbing whatever I wanted on every try. That was a relief.

So after all these out of the way there was nothing further ado other than riding for another ~150km.
It wasn't hard though, time was flying, I love cycling, and I managed to overtake lots of people. Some beat me on the descents, I was still cautious with these brakes and the deep wheels, but whatever.

There was only one point in the race when I felt that I was getting fatigued, around 130km. But then I drank some ISO, ate some sugars, took some caffeine, and a few minutes later I was back on track.

In no time (a little over 6 hours) I made it to the finish line, and I was ready for T2.
