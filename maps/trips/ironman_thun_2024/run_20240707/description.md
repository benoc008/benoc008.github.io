T2 was almost as slow as T1. I already felt the fatigue, so I took my time again. I ate some potatoes, a few bites of my butter honey sandwich, changed my socks and shoes.

About 15m later, I was out jogging. The beginning felt surprisingly easy, but I knew that I won't be able to keep that pace for a long time. As expected I slowed down a few km in.
We had to run 3 laps. The beginning was full of signs with motivational quotes. I don't remember exactly, but they weren't extremely cheesy. I felt the finish coming closer and closer.
But I knew I shouldn't celebrate yet. A marathon is still really long, even though the race guide says I can even crawl to the finish line, I didn't want to.

So I just tried to pace myself, eat as much as I could, kept dringing and left foot right food over and over and over again.

It was a really pleasant surprise to see Balazs cheering as well, he came to cheer and celebrate at the end with us. I met with some other friends on the side of the course as well.

It wasn't easy but after just shy of 4h in, I crossed the finish line, rang the bell and heard the famous words:

"Bence, you are an Ironman"
