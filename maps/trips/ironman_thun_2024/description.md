### Why
I signed up for the Ironman in January. "Swim 2.4 miles (3.8km)! Bike 112 miles (180km)! Run 26.2 miles (42km)! Brag for the rest of your life!" It is something I wanted to do for a few years, I remember the first few weeks and months after I started jogging during Covid. 
I watched a bunch of youtube videos, the Running Channel, GTN and then later when I learnt about cycling - even before I got my first bicycle - GCN.  
It felt an extremely difficult feat but also something doable with hard work. I can't exactly describe what got me so interested. 
Was it the physical challenge or also the fact that it puts the finishers in an exclusive group, I'm not sure. But I definitely liked the idea that it comes with the privilege of calling myself an Ironman. 
Like one of those titles that people can get in video games such as World of Warcraft: "Scarab Lord Kungen" or "Grandmaster Xaryu". Since I probably won't be a "sir" or "dr" anymore, I guess I could still become an Ironman - even if it doesn't come with a legal name change :shrug:.

So after a painful breakup -being dependant on external validation - I was desperate to prove my worth and signing up to this old dream of mine seemed to be a great option. Additionally I was in the best shape of my life, and I really felt like I didn't want to spend so much time training forever, so it was a good timing to top it off with one last big push and an Ironman at the end.

### Training
There are plenty of content online about Ironman prep, usually starting with lofi music, early alarm clocks, coffee from a little machine to make espresso. 
It was exactly like that, 10+ sessions a week, with some double and triple days - I had insomnia because my ex cheating on me bothered me so much, so it was perfect, I had all the time to train early mornings and late nights. 
Until I was about 6 weeks in - that's when the troubles started. I had a little (1st time failed) skin surgery, after which I wasn't allowed to sweat for 2 weeks and I was off the pool for a month.
Then I broke my fingers flying over my handlebars on my new triathlon bike. A few weeks later I broke a rib. But none of these could hold me back from training and even though the preparation wasn't perfect, I got to the start line as ready as I could be.

### Race weekend
Attila and Lili were so kind, they supported me during the entire journey, including race weekend. We got an airbnb and we drove down to Thun on Friday afternoon already, so I could participate in the pre-race briefing.
The summer was really cold until this point, there was still snow in the mountains in June and it was hard to practice open water swimming as the ZÃ¼rich lake was still 14C in May. Every race I did up until this point this year was in freezing cold temperatures and terrible circumstances.

Aligned with the expectations, when I arrived to the briefing there was a big sign at the stage, stating "Water temperature today: 14.1C". Shit. 14C is really cold. 
Most of the briefing was about detailing how everyone should wear neoprene swim caps (or minimum 2 swim caps) and neoprene booties and ear plugs and whatever we can find, because the swim will be painful.
The other takeaway of mine was that except for me literally everyone in the briefing had their legs shaven. I never shaved my legs before, I knew it was a cyclist / triathlete thing and that on the course of a full Ironman it can save minutes even, I wasn't sure if it was necessary.
Well, after seeing this, I knew I had to. 

So right after the briefing we rushed to Decathlon to get neoprene swim caps, but to the clerks biggest surprise "a bunch of triathletes came in a few minutes ago and bought all the neoprene caps, I don't know what's happening". I was too late.
Oh well, at least I could get a set of razors and some sensitive shaving foam in Coop.

The next day I had a few things to do: 
- making friends with the water
- shave my legs
- drop off my bike in the afternoon
- eat as much as I could

The water temperatures got a little warmer, which I wasn't 100% sure if I should be happy about at this point. The dilemma was the following. According to Swiss Triathlon regulations, if the water temperature is below 15C, the swim course has to be shortened. If the air temperature is even colder than the water temperature, it has to be shortened further.
Everyone was talking about the rumors that the swim will be shortened. Just a few weeks before the half Ironman in Rapperswil was only 750m because the water temperature was 13C. We were hoping for something similar. (Or were we not? Are we still Ironmen if we only finish a shortened course? Or Copper Boys at best?)

Anyways, the swim wasn't terrible (1st job done) and the vibes in the city were awesome, even amid the cold and cloudy weather. Sporty people doing sporty stuff all around!

Next up: leg shaving.
I'll never forget Lili's support, it was such a long and tedious process. At first it looked super weird, but to be honest, i quickly got used to it and then it just felt great. If it was an easier process, I'd definitely shave my legs all the time!

The last big task for the day was to drop off the bicycle. It wasn't straightforward as the weather already turned crap and it was raining. The organizers warmed us that we won't be able to cover the bikes for the night, because the winds could easily toss them around then.
So all I did was lubing the chains as well as I could with some wet weather oil and then wrapped around the electronics with some cling foil to make sure it won't get damaged by the water. It is a 7yo used bike after all.

At night I didn't sleep well. I went to bed late, but I was too nervous to sleep anyways. It was very thrilling, even as I'm just writing about it my legs are shaking. Big day coming up, stay tuned.


### Swim (until I upload the activity)
I had to wake up around 4 in the morning to get ready, eat some breakfast and make it to the venue. Lili drove me and she had to be back by 5am, because they closed the roads then.
It was still dark and raining. The contestants were gathering, we were let in at 5:00, the race was supposed to start at 6:30, but there is plenty to do in the morning.  

This is when we have access to the bike for one last time: to check the components, pump the tires, add the bottles, food etc.
This is also the time to add or remove anything from the transition bags. I had some fresh sandwiches and boiled potatoes with me that I wanted to add.  
And lastly, this is the time to change to the wetsuit and do some warm ups. (Bonus point is the toilet break.)

Pumping the tires was straight forward, they had many good quality pumps there for our service, I just had to queue for a few minutes. I was really stuck afterwards though. I wasn't sure if I should do anything else to my bike. I had the bottle of chain oil with me, thinking maybe I should add some more - in case the rain removed it all. But the chain was also still wet and as it was raining, I had no way to dry it anyways to apply a new layer. So eventually I gave up and just prayed that I had there enough. 

After the bike was ready I headed over to the transition bags. Added my little potatoes and sandwiches to the bags and then I got confused again. I had sunscreen with me. Should I use it? It's cloudy and raining... I also had Vaseline, as I was suggested before that I should add some to my wrists and neck, under the wetsuit, but since I never had issues with that, I thought better not to try anything new on race day and just ignored that as well.

But since I didn't do there much, after a quick pee, I was just chilling by my bags. People around me were changing already, but I didn't want to remove my rain jacket so early, there was plenty of time still.
Around this time we just heard the news from the loudspeaker as well, that the water temperature was measured as 16.1C therefore the swim will not be shortened. At this point to be honed, I would have enjoyed a shortened swim, but as explained above, it might be better than we were set to complete the full race.
Eventually I gave in and changed. Not sure if it was a good idea yet, as there was no way to use the toilet (comfortably) in the wetsuit anymore.

I walked over to the start line to do my warm up, but at that point I was already shivering. I procastinated for a little longer, walking around, checking out the start zones, eating my pre-race gel, etc. I really didn't want to get into the water, but I knew I had to, so I did. It was freezing cold, definitely felt colder than 16C. Time flew really fast, so I only had a few minutes in the water before I had to leave.
I queued up in my start block (pretty much the last one, I'm slow haha).

All the swim starts I've experienced this year were really similar:
- The sun is barely up, it is grey and foggy, we can't see much
- A loud sound from the speaker start screaming in german, telling us to jump into the water
- The mass of people swimming toward some random obstacles in the dark water

This is pretty much how I imagine D-Day.

Anyways, this time the difference was that right at the start they tried easing up out mood by playing some music. You know what was the first song? Thunderstruck. Excellent choice, everybody was just nodding their head left and right.

Here in the queue I met a friend of mine, N. We couldn't chat much as we both had earplugs in. At the start line he waved to me, saying he will stay there for a bit longer. Good luck!  
Good luck to you too, my friend. Let's roll.

Interestingly the water wasn't deep for a long time, we walked in like 50m until we could start swimming. As we crawled further and further away from the shore, the water got significantly colder. It didn't bother me too much though, I just kept pacing. I only ever swam this much once before, and that was in a swimming pool. Actually 2 swimming pools, the 1st half outdoors and then I felt too cold and went indoor to finish, and by the end, my legs were cramping.
Swimming was clearly my weakest point. I knew I can do it because I had some 3k sessions and a few open water sessions in me as well, but I was definitely only going for survival there.
The fog didn't help much and the color of the turning buoys was almost the same as the beginner swim caps, which didn't help much with the navigation. As I wasn't wearing contact lenses anyways, I just focused on swimming near people and tried to reserve my energy.
Luckily there wasn't much fighting in the water and the first turn came fairly early. I thought I made a great progress and time was flying - later turned out just because I didn't check the course thoroughly enough. Unfortunately the first turn was far from the halfway mark, but I only noticed that when I was getting really tired and feeling sick in the water.
By this point the cold really hit a couple of people around me and they were asking for the rescue motorboats. The boats however made some really unpleasant weaves, making me nauseous. I stopped and looked around quickly to relax a bit when I noticed a nubmer on the big buoy next to me. It said "21".

What could "21" mean I wondered until about 2-2.5 minutes later I noticed another number on the next buoy: "22". And then another one on the next: "23". Oh no, it can't be real. Please don't tell me I still have 1500m to swim, this is terrible. I already started feeling the burn on my neck from the neoprene - I should have used that Vaseline after all.
But at this point there was no escape, I was 1500m away fromt he shore, the fastest way out is swimming, so I just kept moving one arm after the other until I finally noticed the bottom of the lake again. Not just because Swiss lakes are so clear, but as I mentioned, the shore wasn't deep at all. 
I knew that I still had a bit to swim, up the channel, to the exit point, but I really felt the relief there.

As expected, a few minutes later I was out of the water. T1 time, stay tuned!
