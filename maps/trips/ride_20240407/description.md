## Description
The Zuri Velo Cup is organised for the 2nd year in a row - promoting the 2024 Road Cycling World Championship here in Zurich. The format is really simple: ride through the 11 historic segments of the area to collect points and when you are done, you'll be rewarded with a pair of free cycling socks!

The challenge is running for the entire season, but there are dedicated days to do in groups, also supported by refreshment stations along the way. It's not too late to sign up, head over to the [website](https://velocup.zurich2024.com/) for details!

The weather forecast was nice enough and I wanted to do a long ride, but I didn't have time to go far, because I had apartment viewing appointments in the afternoon (I was moving out.).
I was getting the hang of this whole long riding alone thing, so I wasn't really thinking about inviting anyone, but the night before a friend texted me if I was planning to go cycling tomorrow. His words, how the conversation went down:

"Yesterday at 10pm  
Me: Hi Bence, do you plan to go for a ride tomorrow?  
Bence: Hi! Yes, I plan to do alll zvc segments  
Me: Isn't it more than 2k ascent? You think we will still have the ability to walk the next day?:)  
Bence: haha i have no doubts :D See you tomorrow at 7:30"  

And that's how it happened, we started at 7:30, the sun was already up, we did a good pace and had breakfast in Winterthur in a cute little bakery.

We had to do a loop around and we crossed Winterthur once more. This is where we were getting a bit low on energy, so on the way out we stopped again for some sugar water and a Snickers. :sweat_smile:.
I'm still fascinated how some sugars can always keep me going.

The next big crash was around 30-40km from the finish. I felt a little time pressure to make it back before the visitors come, but I was also out of water and gummy bears, so we had to stop. Luckily we found a shady little store that was open and had products from - I believe the Balkans and Turkey - I'm not sure. I've never seen them before, but they were full of sugars. I even had a RedBull, which I think I last time drank during the University, the night before some exams to keep me awake to study. :sweat_smile:. But I have to admit, it works. We finished the last climb and flew back into Zurich along the lake on the last 20kms with an average of ~37km/h like some fighter jets. 

Very fun ride, and finishing strong is always an extra satisfaction!
Thanks for joining, my friend!
