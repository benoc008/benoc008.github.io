## Description
Wow. Just wow. This island is so beautiful, the feeling i had here reminds me of when I was first hiking in Switzerland: It can’t be real. But it is, and I really recommend it to everyone that loves going outdoors.
The island is perfect for hiking, trail running, mountain biking, scuba diving and I’ve heard for surfing as well. On rest days there are plenty of opportunities for dolphin / whale watching trips or simply chilling by one of the many natural pools around the island.

### Climate
The weather is quite pleasant all around the year, I was visiting for a week in April, and the temperatures were between 15-27C (including the night). It was mostly sunny, with some clouds on some days, but no rain. The water temperature was around 19C, which is good for short swims even without a wetsuit.
I’ve read that the winter is in general more rainy, so check the forecasts before booking! On the other hand I've heard that the summer is really high season there, the island and the trails can easily get crowded.

### Cycling
I’ve heard that Madeira is a mountain bike paradise, and I’ve indeed seen plenty of mountain bikers. I’m a roadie however and came here for the steep climbs, which - let me say this - exceeded my expectations. 

If I wanted to sum up the Island in 1 picture, this would be it:

![steep_road](maps/trips/madeira2024/IMG_1503.jpg)

The roads of Madeira are by far the steepest I’ve ever seen. And not just some, all of them! It feels like there is no flat in there, it’s either up or down, no in between. I really can't emphasise enough the average steepness of these roads. So make sure you check some cycling heatmaps before planning your routes, otherwise you might end up pushing your bike (either up or down). :see_no_evil:

Steepness however is not the biggest difficulty. Unfortunately the road quality is also not quite perfect. I know that I’m spoiled in Switzerland, but some sections are definitely in the really dangerous category here. Uneven surfaces from years (or decades) of patching, debris on the road, and huge potholes makes the descents quite technical on these steep streets.

The other big factor is the traffic. Outside of the cities it is not so heavy, as there are many smaller roads that avoid highways. But these roads are not just steep and bumpy, but also really narrow with many sharp turns. The local drivers are really experienced flying up and down these one lane streets with high speed, tourists are not so much. 
So be alert at all times.  
Traffic in the cities however is just terrible. The roads are just as steep and narrow there as in the middle of the island and the quality is also awful. But with really heavy high speed traffic and there are  basically 0 bike lanes (or sidewalks). You either drive or just pray for your life on the side of the street. Actually you should probably pray when driving as well, it doesn't feel safe for sure.
 
There are efforts to improve road quality and there are a lot of constructions ongoing. This results in:
- temporary traffic lights on painfully steep roads
- detouring the traffic to smaller roads that are sometimes really really extremely steep. So steep that once I had to dismount of my bike and push it. Not up, but down!

Another difficulty is the tunnels. There are more than 200 of them on this tiny island. Have good lights with you and check beforehand if your route goes through some of them, so you are not surprised too late.

And lastly the wind. It is an island in the middle of the ocean, windy days are expected. Don’t be stupid like me, leave your aero bike and deep section wheels at home, you won’t need those here. At one point I actually had to turn around and finish my ride early, because the wind was so strong, I just couldn’t hold my bike. 

If you keep these things in mind, the climbs will be very rewarding. When I arrived to Pico del Arieiro the tourists were clapping to me, and then “interviewed” me about the climb and my bike and stuff haha. :grinning:

Funny thing I’ve noticed is where local cyclists go to ride after work. During a run by the coast, I’ve seen multiple single cyclists and a group ride going back and forth between a roundabout and the end of the main Pier, as it was already closed from road traffic. Like running on a track, but it’s a group ride. :grinning:


### Hiking / Trail running
Most of the trails are very well signed and maintained (with lots of stairs). 
The trailheads are easily approachable by car and there are many little restaurants / cafes to grab some snacks and to refill the bottles. Tap water is of good quality everywhere around the island, there are even some drinking wells in and around the cities.

One caveat though: the popular trails are quite crowded and the not popular ones are often simply taken over by mountain bikers. I’ve seen a couple of hiking heatmaps on strava, that by now are marked as mountain bike trails. The alternative is often the open road. :confused:

I’ve also ended up on some not so popular trails that were completely overgrown. Maybe just because April is still not high season, but be prepared for that.

I was a little bit reluctant going on unmarked or closed trails, because I read just before coming here that a French couple died a few days before, because they slipped on an unofficial trail.
As I arrived to Madeira with a broken rib and two broken fingers, I decided to take it easy this time. :sweat_smile:

The terrain and the nature is very diverse. From city cobblestones to forests, stairs, desert rocks everything can be seen. 

10/10 Hiking/trail running destination!

### Driving in Madeira

As I wrote previously, most of the roads are extremely steep, narrow, bad quality and have a heavy traffic. Driving however is probably still the most comfortable way to get around the island.

#### Alternatives

Originally I was planning to just cycle to my hiking / running destinations on the other sides of the island, but I found the traffic and the steep roads already so tiring, that I quickly gave up on this idea.

There are buses, from multiple different companies, depending the destination. Some are on google maps, some just on Portuguese websites. Some sell tickets online, some just on the bus, pay by cash. The schedule is often also not so frequent, so do your research before heading to the other side of the island, to make sure you can get back as well. 

Taxi is also definitely an option. A rental car gives you the freedom to easily visit multiple places / stores in a day, but calling a taxi every time definitely works too. If you take only 1 or 2 a day, it might be even cheaper than renting a car. No Uber, but there is Bolt which is usually half the price of the regular Taxis - when they are available. (Be careful with just hailing Taxis from the side of the road, they might try to scam you.)

If I didn’t scare you from driving in Madeira, pay attention to the following. There seems to be a hierarchy between the vehicles, basically based on their size. 

Buses > work trucks > SUVs > cars > cyclists > pedestrians.

The stronger has the right to go first. 

It is very common to just honk in the corners to let others know that a car is approaching, the one that honks first has the right to pass, the others pull aside.

### Where to stay
In general I would suggest to avoid Funchal. While the vibe in the old town is pretty unique, traffic and parking is a mess. It is much easier to start rides / drive to the trailheads from a smaller place. Within Funchal, the western part seems to have better infrastructure, wider streets, parking places and even bike lanes!
And getting around is fairly fast anyways, apart of the steepness, the island is small.

### Before the trip

I enjoy keeping myself busy and I wanted to go to Madeira for a while. Actually I started planning this trip with my ex girlfriend, little did I know, she was already planning with someone else at the time. :slightly_smiling_face: Oh well. I would have went alone, but a good friend joined me as this supposed to be a great scuba diving region and she is really into that!

My original plan was cycling through this hilly island, running, hiking, trying scuba diving and eating good food! The timing is just before the Zurich marathon, so I planned the harder sports stuff for the first half and the scuba diving and easy hikes for the second. My plans got a bit derailed though when a weird pain in my chest didn’t get any better after a week and I went to the doctor where I learned that I have a fractured rib (probably the fall on the 1st day of my Vienna trip). :shrug:
Since I already cycled a 1000kms since the accident and had some runs as well, including a 30k+ hilly one, a little broken rib won’t stop me from enjoying my vacation. I might skip scuba diving though, the doctor explicitly said that I’ll die if I do it lol. :sweat_smile:

*On a side note, while I was there I also asked her about skydiving that I signed up for and is in 3 weeks. She was just laughing, looking at my tied up fingers that I damaged in another accident 3 weeks ago. Maybe I should take a rest instead! But that was not a definitive no. :thinking: There are other bad signs though, for one, the company we hired lost their airplane last month and the pilot died as well. - Explained to me a friend who is also jumping, 3 days after they lost a helicopter (with the pilot and 2 skiers) at the Air Glacier base where she works. I’ll think about it.*

Anyways, back to Madeira. After my slightly troublesome bike rental in Barcelona, I decided to take my bike with me this time. I’ve explored my options:

1. Swiss air for flights from Zürich provides a free cardboard bike carrying box. This sounds awesome, but I was not 100% sure how durable they are and how painful it is to pack a bike right at the airport. Did anyone do it already? I’d appreciate any details in the comments! (instagram) Maybe I will try this one day, just outwards and then cycle back to Zürich.

2. A proper bike case. Swiss (Edelweiss) has the bike included in the luggage price, so I just had to get one. The internet said that a hard case is the best, but they are really expensive, so for a first flight, I borrowed a semi-hard one from a friend. 

The advantage of this is that one can fill the gaps in the bike bag with other stuff like clothes, and then there is nothing else to carry on the flight, just a backpack.  
This plan also didn’t materialise completely as there is a 23kg limit on the case, and for me it quickly jumped to 25 when I took it to the counter. I think if it was a couple dkgs the lady at the airport wouldn’t have had any problems, but it was just too much. She said I either take out 2 kilos worth of stuff or I pay 150chf extra. By the time she finished her sentence I already had a bag of clothes and my water bottles fully stuffed with gels and chocolate under my arms. :rofl: 23.00 - she said - perfect. 
Then I had to take it to the “Bulky Items” counter where no one checked the weight again, so I think I could have put my stuff back. But I don’t like to cheat, and I could still fit everything in my carry-on, so it was all good. 
I’m glad I did this the day before the flight though, it was much less stressful this way. (Yes, checking in a day before is possible. Also there is a service to pick up the luggage for 50-60 francs which is actually not so crazy.)
Now I’m just praying that it is still in 1 piece. Or rather as many pieces as I’ve disassembled it to. Took me a good minute to pack it. 

#### Cycling in Madeira
Madeira is famous for its steep hills and wild fauna, which makes it perfect for hiking and mountain biking. I’m not a mountain biker though, I already feel dizzy on gravel and I hope I spent enough time in hospitals / praxises for this year.

According to the internet road cycling is not impossible though! I’ll have to watch out for the **extremely** steep roads both uphill and downhill. They are also told to be narrow and have really sharp turns, often with traffic from the opposite direction. I’ve planned a couple of routes out of curiosity on Strava and basically there are no flat sections. It’s either up or down. Exciting! Apart from these, there are 200 tunnels on the island, which I’m also not the biggest fan of. My scariest cycling moment to this day is still when we were flying down from the Grand St Bernard pass to Martigny and there was a 6km long steep tunnel. I think we averaged like 70kph between heavy traffic, until we were stopped by a red light. Yes, in the tunnel. So when I read about this I immediately ran to the first bike shop to get a new rear light that properly fits on my new aero seat post. *I was actually thinking about getting the so well praised Garmin Varia. I have many bad things to say about Garmin, but everyone seems to enjoy these lights, so I might give them a try one day. They were not in stock though, so I just got a regular light this time.* Now I’ll have one on the bike, one on my back. Or something, I just want to be visible. Wish me luck!

### After the trip
Wow, this island is beautiful. It’s very different from the alps, or even the neighbouring island, Tenerife, which I visited ~1.5 years ago. It’s much more green, everywhere, maybe except from the top of some peaks. There are very densely grown forests and bushes, from species that none of the other two examples have. There are bananas, sure, but also lots of ferns, and bushy bushes and stuff, I don’t know, I’m not a botanist, but it’s different. And not the same ones everywhere, they change quite a bit by the regions within the island. But more on this in the daily posts!

And my bike arrived with no major issues as well!

In the first days I managed to do a nice ride and a very nice, probably my favourite trail run yet. I wasn’t exhausted, but I tried not to overdo it, so I took a rest day then. My left leg wasn’t feeling a 100% and the Marathon was approaching - that I clearly didn’t train properly for, due to a surgery, illness, injuries and lack of discipline - so I decided to take it easy for the rest of the week. 

*I felt the inner pressure that I’m on vacation on this beautiful Island, I should torture myself harder and go on more trail runs and climb more climbs with my bike. When I closed my eyes for a second, I saw my ex girlfriend’s judging eyes on me, for being weak and lazy. So I just practiced self love and went for some easy hikes, runs, short swims and even a massage instead! I hope my therapist will be proud! :sweat_smile:*

I really enjoyed this long week, I’m pleasantly tired but at the same time full of energy. My first vacation in years, when I come back home relaxed and fully charged both mentally and physically, and not completely destroyed and exhausted. 😅
