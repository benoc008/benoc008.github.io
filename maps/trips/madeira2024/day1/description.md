I woke up at 3:30 in the morning, the Uber arrived at 4:15, my flight was at 6:10. I was afraid that I would be completely destroyed all day, but I managed to get some sleep on the 4 hour long flight, and even some breakfast! What a surprise, I havenâ€™t had meals on european flights since covid.

Arriving to the Christiano Ronaldo Airport I immediately felt the warm, pleasantly humid and salty air on my skin. I fairly quickly found my bike bag at the oversized luggage counter, but I was too afraid to inspect it before getting home first. ðŸ™ˆ 

I met up with my friend a bit later in the airport and after dropping the luggage at the airbnb, we went for a little hike nearby. We took the Cable car up to Monte where we headed towards the forests. I canâ€™t emphasise enough in these blog posts, but it was really steep. The views were great, but we didnâ€™t move very fast, so we had to cut it short, and even then, we missed the last cable car down. It wasnâ€™t a big deal, just a 3km walk home in the city - with 500m elevation drop. 

The streets terrified me, I was getting really anxious for cycling the next day. Iâ€™m used to be really anxious on holidays, as in the past 2 years we always planned some very demanding sports events, but these roads and this traffic really challenged my will. :fearful:

We ended up ordering food for dinner and I assembled the bike. Everything went fine with the transport, except for 2 things:

1. The spongy tubes I put around the frame to further protect it kind of melted on the frame, as some sticky gluey thing and it took me a good while to remove it.

2. I pushed the saddle all the way down so it fits in the bag and wonâ€™t wobble around. I couldnâ€™t pull it out. 

I tried for half an hour, I tried pulling, upside-down pushing, shaking, hitting, everything that the internet suggested. But when I read some forum posts where they said that they had to completely cut the seat-post off to fix it, I was getting really desperate. I felt like a complete failure. I came here to ride my bike, and I canâ€™t even assemble it. I was already looking for bike shops where they might be able to help me, when my friend, who borrowed me his suitcase suggested to try to twist it and pull it at the same time - really hard. It finally moved. I was so happy, such a relief. Prepared everything I needed for the ride the next day and went to bed, it was getting pretty late and I had a big challenge ahead.
