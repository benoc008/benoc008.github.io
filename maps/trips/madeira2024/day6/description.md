Another lazy day, my leg pain was getting better, but it was already Wednesday, so I wanted to keep it easy for the Marathon.
We drove to the middle of the island, and found an awesome little gem. Quiet, barely any tourists and the views were amazing. There was a little restaurant as well, called Naibers. The best food I had on the island all week. Nothing special, but everything made with care and good ingredients. And the staff was really nice too!

We went to check out some natural pools in this area as well - there were supposed to be some rivers. But either because it was not high season yet - or more likely, because there wasn't enough rain lately, these looked more like channels next to a dumpster than stomething i'd like to take a dip in. I took some pictures, but decided not to share them.

In the evening I went for a little run to move my legs a bit. I didn't want to do tons of elevation, which is not straightforward in this island, so I was just running along the shore and found the big pier where i could do some laps. I was not the only one with this idea. After the pier closed, I've seen many people - alone or in groups - running there, just back and forth in that ~500m stretch.
What I've found more interesting was that not just runners used this space, but also cyclists. :sweat_smile: There was a roundabout at the beginning, where they turned around and then came back over and over and over again. 

And of course, I had to take a selfie with Ronaldo on the way back!
