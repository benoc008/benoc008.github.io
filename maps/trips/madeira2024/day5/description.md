The sunrise tour!

We started the day pretty early and drove up to Pico Areeiro to watch the sunrise. I knew the place pretty well, as I've been up there twice already. I even knew the secret spot to go to - that my new Romanian friend recommended. Unfortunately it tourned out to be not-so-secret, because it was already full when I got up there. Anyways, I found myself a nice little spot not too far from it, and waited for the magic to happen.
When I started planning this trip many months before, one of the main things I wanted to do was watching the stars from the mountain with no light pollution. That still has to wait, because though there was no light pollution, unfortunately it was a little bit cloudy, so I couldn't see any stars. :slightly_frowning_face:
But for the sunrise, maybe cluds made the colors even more playful. What do you think?

Once the sun was fully up, we headed to the eastern corner of the island - where i failed to cycle to a couple days prior - and did a little hiking.

We really wanted to have a coffee and was hoping to find something on the way there, but without any success. We've seen on the map, that there is a little bar on the top, so that was our next hope and motivation for the hike. But first, we had to enter the national park. In Madeira, some tourist attractions - like some national parks or viewing points require a ticket. The tickets are sold online, and in this case - a bit out of the city - they even provided wifi to buy the tickets there. (A simple POS terminal like at some petrol station toilettes would have been easier, but I'm not complaining.). Maybe our little struggle with the ticket purchase was also our luck, because by the time we got our tickets, a food truck parked at the entrance, and sold espresso!

The hike was spectacular. No other comment to it. :smile:
The little bar just opened as we arrived there, and after a cold coke, we headed back to the car.

After some lunch, we went to the North to enjoy some natural swimming pools, and some fresh pineapple juice straight from a pineapple! Cheers!
