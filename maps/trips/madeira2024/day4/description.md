This is Monday, the 2nd day after my big run. I decided to rest on Sunday, because I had to reserve my body for the Zurich marathon in a few days, and I thought that I still have enough time on the Island to do cool stuff - and I was on a vacation after all, I do whatever I want. Or so I thought, I have to admit, I still felt the burning pressure to perform. I haven't had a vacation in a long time (not even a weekend really) where I could just rest, I always had to do something challenging, it didn't matter how tired I was.

But with all my willpower I stayed put, and actually I even booked a massage! It felt really good and did well for my legs!

On the way back I walked around the shore and noticed that some people actually swim in the Ocean without wetsuits. I really wanted to give it a try - and I was supposed to be training open water swimming anyways, so I decided to give it a go. I went to Decathlon to get some swimming goggles and a pair of swimming shorts. (Yes, I know, I went to Madeira without swimming shorts, but I read that the water is too cold for swimming.)

By the time I got back from the store, even those few people were gone, but I went for a dip anyways. It was my shortest swim ever. :sweat_smile:
The water was not painfully cold, I think I could have stayed in the water for at least half an hour. Apart from some seaweed near the shore it was also really clean, I've even seen some schools of fish as well. The real problem was the salt water and the current (tides maybe?). Or I'm just a little pussy, I don't know, but the weaves tossing me left and right and the salt water burning my mouth made me want to vomit. So just after 7 long minutes, I decided to abandon my challenge and escaped to the shore.

I took some selfies though so I could show people how cool I was, swimming in the Ocean. Then I realized that I don't even have anyone that I would send such photos, so just wrapped my stuff and left the beach.

In the afternoon we went for a little hike. The beginning of the trail looked very new, like as if they made it the same day new. Then it joined an older path I guess, which lead through some small and cold and really really dark caves, with the little channel on the side - the Madeira special. I have to admit something. I'm not actually a good hiker. When I read trail descriptions and see that it requires "surefootedness" I always tell to myself "Yup, that's not me.". But I tried to act cool and just kept pacing with the light of my phone's flash.
