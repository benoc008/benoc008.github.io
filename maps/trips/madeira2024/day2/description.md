Friday morning, the sunrise is pretty late on the island at this time of the year, around 7:30. I wanted to start as early as I could to avoid the morning traffic, but then I was thinking, maybe the locals are already on their way to work or school at 7:30 so I decided to start a little bit later. The ride I planned wasn’t too long and the big challenge, the climb to the highest road in the island was at the very beginning. I thought if I make it up there, the rest of the day will be easy. I just have to go down and then I wanted to visit the north-east corner, but that's a piece of cake - so I thought.

At first I went all the way down to the sea, just to make it a proper Sea to Summit ride. There were some red lights on the steep streets, but the traffic in the city wasn’t that bad. It was around 9:30, and once I got out of it - about 600m elevation - the roads became really empty. 
I didn’t want to stop, so I only took a couple of pictures while riding, but the views were amazing.
First the city, then a green forest, which was getting yellower and sparser as I was approaching the peak. The very top was a bit deserted too, it reminded me of the Teide ascent, there is even an observatory at Pico do Areeiro.  
As I said, it was steep, but actually not painfully. I was looking at my gps and during the first 12km it didn’t show anything below 13%. It’s probably not that accurate however, [Cycling cols](https://www.cyclingcols.com/col/Arieiro) suggest more like 10-11%. The funny thing was, after climbing these roads for more than an hour, when the steepness dropped to 6% it really felt as if I was going downhill. :sweat_smile:   
I didn’t know what was still ahead of me, so I took it easy, averaged around 200 Watts to the top, where the tourists were literally clapping when they saw that I came up with a bike. :see_no_evil:  
Some of them kind of interviewed me, asking about the climb and my bike, they wanted to hold it to see how heavy it is, etc.. They were really vute, but the whole situation was really funny. :smile: Not gonna lie though, it felt good.  
I haven’t seen a single cyclist until this point, so I understand why I was a tourist attraction.

I had a sandwich, an ice cream and a coke on the top, and I was just hoping that this was not my last lunch, after seeing on the way up what's waiting for me downhill. :see_no_evil:

I was very afraid of the descent, because on the way up I’ve seen the road quality. Bad roads on the way up are usually not an issue. I'm always much slower and I have more time to notice the road bumps, potholes and manoeuvre around them. But when flying down, oh boy. I was pulling my breaks as hard as I could with my little broken fingers. And the breaks were crying out loud.  
I made a couple of pauses to rest my hand and my brakes, at one point I even disassembled the front one it was so loud. I was afraid that the pads are completely gone or something, even though they were fairly new. After that the noise was gone - probably just some dirt or dust got stuck on the pads. After this little mechanical break I was happy and confident to continue my way down.  
Once I made it back to the city, I took a turn to head towards the corner of the island. Unfortunately I didn’t get too far. :smiling_face_with_tear:  
Terrible road quality, really heavy traffic, many road works and the steepness made the ride really unpleasant. I kept going however until I faced my next unexpected challenge: the wind. Meteo Blue said around 30-40kph, but I’m sure that the gusts were even stronger. Now I know that I was stupid for going there with 60mm deep wheels, but it was too late. I really felt unsafe holding onto the bike, often drifting towards the middle of the road, in this heavy traffic. So at one point I just stopped to look for alternatives. As I was just standing next to my bike, looking at the strava route planner, the wind was so strong that I could barely hold it. That’s when I decided that I have enough broken ribs for now, I don’t need an accident on the first day of my vacation and just turned around.  
The way back was plenty exciting too. At one point due to the roadworks I was sent to a sideroad that was so narrow and steep and had a sharp bend at the end that I was just too afraid to ride it. I had to get off of my bike and push it down this cobblestone road. Even walking there wasn't easy. :sweat_smile:

I was a little bit disappointed that my ride got cut so short and I had nothing else planned for the day, but still felt good, because of the climb, and I was looking forward to the next days. Continuing from here.
