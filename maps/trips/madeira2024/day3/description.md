I was still a bit tired from waking up so early to catch the flight, so I took my time in the morning and only started my hike at 9:30. I wanted to do something similar, sea to summit, but this time on foot, and the summit was a bit further, because there is a hiking trail (actually thousands of stairs) to the highest point of the island: Pico Ruivo.

I packed my new trail running backpack, poles, lots of water, some snacks and walked down to the shore. At this point I still haven’t decided what I was gonna do exactly. I thought that Ruivo is pretty close to Areerio and that I can maybe do a little detour on the way back. Then just take a bus or hitch hike back down. But at this point I felt really free, I didn’t want to make big commitments yet, just to get to the first “bridge”: Ruivo.

I didn’t even know if I wanted to hike or run, I just kept pacing up. The road was pretty steep. Definitely too steep for me to run it, but since it was even asphalt, I also couldn’t climb as fast as on stairs. I felt the sun on my head and after passing by 3 sports stores, I decided to stop in one to buy a cap. I haven’t had one since school, because I always thought that I look stupid in them. I guess I don’t care anymore. :shrug:
In the store I was chatting to the guy who was running it. He asked me if I was there to do the MIUT, the local ultra trail race. 150kms with 7000 elevation. I just smiled and told him no. I’m really far from that, haha. He is doing it, along with some 5000 people, pretty cool. I wished him good luck and kept going in my new hat!

After a while the asphalt ended and I was finally on a cobblestone trail. I took out my poles finally and kept pushing.

It was really pleasant, but was over shortly after and I found myself on the main road for cars again. I was looking for the hiking trails, but there was nothing around, and since the road didn’t feel as steep on foot as with the bicycle the day before, I finally started to run.

From here on I was pretty much running the whole day except for some shorter sections. The route from here on was mixed though. I took some detours to find the proper hiking trails, but learned that the ones that are on the strava heatmap are often mountain bike routes; which are obviously dangerous to take. I’m not sure what confused strava, maybe some hikers ignore it, or they close them from the bikes for running races sometimes? Anyways, I kept running wherever I could, road, grass, bit of trails, until I noticed a guy between the trees, just next to me. I quickly jumped over and asked him about the hiking/running trails here. Since we had roughly the same pace we started chatting and kept running together to Areerio. A very nice Romanian guy, who moved to Madeira for 2 months, just to to run. He works remotely, and in his free time enjoys the island. Really cool. (I wrote in a previous post that I never end up being alone, I was right, right? haha)  

He only planned a 2.5 hour run for this day, and then he hitch hiked back to the city, so we switched contacts and said our good byes, but before he left, he recommended me a route to the other side of the island. It goes  all the way to Santana, and since I had no plans where to go next anyways, I decided to take it!  
From Areerio the trail was getting pretty crowded with tourists, but they were actually really nice, they all jumped out of my way when they noticed that I was running there. The terrain became rocky, with many many stairs. There were even some tunnels, that I was not prepared for and I even had to use my phone’s flash light to navigate. :sweat_smile:

At the peak of Ruivo I took another little snack break, refilled my bottles and kept going towards another popular hiking trail: Levada something something, I didn't check the name. :sweat_smile:

The shortcut on the way there was pretty steep, mostly in a forest with roots and wooden stairs. One even flipped out from its place under my feet. Luckily no new injury though! :sweat_smile: Not many people took this path, it was really empty and this little accident got me thinking. What if I twist my ankle here in the middle of nowhere? I’m alone and there might be 1 hiker/hour there. There is no Rega to pick me up with a helicopter, I would have to suffer my way through the rest of the hike to get to the trailhead and ask for help there or call a taxi. Anyways, this just made me a bit more cautious, I kept running.

The hike then was flat for almost 10kms. The path lead through the channels and was quite narrow, so I could only run slower there, but it didn’t bother me, I was not on a race and I really enjoyed my time. I already had more than 1000m downhill and my knees were still perfectly fine. I was really happy and grateful, because previously I always had issues with this. (I guess more training and the trail running tips I got from the up2peak guys really helped me.) When I got to the end, I had some snacks at the trailhead again.

Refilled my bottles one last time and headed down to the village of Santana. The terrain changed again. Red coloured rocks, like clay, challenging to run on for me, but I enjoyed the practice. And then I finally made it to the village. I wanted to go down to the shore, but the village ended in a big cliff. There was a path down, with a huge danger sign, so I decided that it was enough for me. I didn’t want to overdo it, I already had 40kms and 2300 up and down in my legs, no need for an injury - especially as the Zurich marathon is in 1 week.

The view was beautiful. I really took my time there to admire it, I was just sitting there for 5 minutes, enjoying it, when I realised that I just missed the last bus back to Funchal.
It was getting late, but there were still some tourists around. I asked them for a ride, but they went to the other direction. My phone was getting low on battery, so I didn’t want to risk it further and called a taxi back to the city. What a day!

### Aftermath
Making this blog took me a while, I wrote this post on the flight back from Madeira. Now reading it again almost half a year later, I had some time to digest it, and I believe that this was really a special day. I really really enjoyed this run, the scenery, the people, the length, how my legs kept moving. I'm still surpirsed how was I able to walk back home after dinner 5kms the same day. One of my favorite days ever, but definitely my favorite run yet.
