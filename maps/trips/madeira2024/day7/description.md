The last full day on the island. The original plan was that I try scuba diving, but since I broke a rib a few weeks before (on my Vienna trip) I was suggested not to. The alternative: whale watching.

You know, I used to be a negative person, but believe me, I'm improving a lot, especially since I found help from a psychologist. However I don't want to put this any other way than it was. Dead boring. For like 3 hours straight we were sitting in a tiny ass inflatable motorboat, roaming the shore (a few km from the actual island, so too far to just jump and escape). We went ahead a few hundred meters and then stopped. Waited to see if a whale or dolphin was coming. It wasn't. A few minutes later we went a bit further. Still nothing. Like an hour in, someone saw something, and we decided to follow it. From this point on the game was as follows.

We see the whale spraying the water in the distance. We turn the engines on, and go exactly where we saw it happen. Wait there for 10 minutes, to see the whale spraying the water again - of course - in the distance. Enginges on again, sprint to the location.
Of course the whale was not interested in us, it didn't stay in place to wait for us there. It moved on. We however failed to realize that. It was a relief to finally get back to the shore.

In the afternoon we did another last hike. It was beautiful as everything on this island. Had a very good coffee in a little mountain hut like place and then headed back home to pack our stuff and get ready for the flight the next day.

And this wraps my little Madeira vacation. The memories and feelings I had here will stay with me for a long time. I hope you enjoyed reading. Until the next one, adeus!
