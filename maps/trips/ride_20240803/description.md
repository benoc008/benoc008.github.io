## Description

The passes around Andermatt are some of the most spectacular ones I've had the pleasure to ride on. 

With no order of importance, the [Alpen Brevet](https://alpenbrevet.ch/) lists the following ones in the region:
- Sustenpass
- Nufenenpass
- Grimselpass
- Gotthardpass
- Furkapass
- Oberalppass
- Lukmanierpass

From which I had the chance to ride on each except for Lukmanier and can only recommend all of them. Maybe not as part of the Alpen Brevet, because I've only heard bad things about this particular event - however the challenge last year was fun (not timed, all season).

[Alpen Paesse](https://www.alpen-paesse.ch/) has up to date information if a given pass in Switzerland is open.

Most of these - maybe with the exception of Furka - are in general not extremely crowded as there are alternative highways or tunnels for cars.
I wouldn't recommend Furka in rush hours on weekends, but otherwise a pleasure to ride them, as in most places around Switzerland: the drivers are patient and careful with cyclists. There are nice little restaurants on the top of the passes for a bottle refill or some snacks too.

The only other think to pay attention to is the cobble stones on the Tremola of the Gottharpass. The Southern side of the pass has (with some breaks) 12km of cobblestone descent (the other side only 3km) - which is beautiful, but quite painful to ride on, especially to descend on.
The cobbles are really good quality, but still cobbles. I assume wider tires, or any kind of suspension makes the descent more pleasant. I remember the first time I was riding on it I had to stop on the descent multiple times, simply because my hands were in so much pain from the long and constant vibration that I could no longer feel my fingers and was afraid I won't be able to pull the brakes.

Starting in Andermatt probably the shortest to accumulate 3000m elevation is to start on Furka, then continue on Nufenen and then finish on Gotthard. This will end up under 100km with over 3000m of elevation. A beautiful ride.

For those who aim for a little more - like I did in this ride - swapping Furka to two other passes: Susten and Grimsel can increase the elevation to over 5000m and still under 200km. 

The ultimate loop without repeating routes is probably Susten - Grimsel - Nufenen - (then down to Biasca) Lukmanier - Oberalp. This should be 270km with approx 7000m of elevation. A long day for sure.

Not sure what else to add here, if anyone has any questions, just shoot them on Instagram!

(Writing months later)
After the Ironman I had another challenge for the summer that I was probably even more afraid of than the long distance triathlon: Tour des Stations ([as covered in GNC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwKvYNQh3uY) - except I only signed up for the Superfondo with 7000m elevation. Still, much more than what I have ever done in a day.).

So I knew I had no time to waste and I had to put in those elevation meters in my legs if I wanted to finish this run.  
Thought a nice loop around Andermatt would be a good training. The weather seemed to be perfect so I set my alarm early on a Saturday morning and took the train to my starting point: Erstfeld.

My favorite starting point is Fl√ºelen, it is so beautiful there by the lake with all the mountains around. It is kind of a pain to get there since the road by the Vierwaldstaettersee is closed - and anyways for this day, it was plenty enough of riding from Erstfeld.
I had a direct connection from Zug, so it was really convenient, and at 8 in the morning the climbing slowly started right from km 1. 

I took a quick toilette break in the Gemeinde haus in Wassen, refilled my bottles from the local well and hit the first pass: Susten.
I felt strong and pushed some nice watts. It was still kind of chilly in the morning, so it felt good, but I knew I won't be able to sustain all day the over 200W average that I put out to the top there. But I didn't care, the views compensated me for my efforts (check along the route!).
I was slowly riding into the clouds, which was both fun and scary at the same time. To my biggest fears the clouds were even thicker on the other side:

There were actually a bunch of cyclists up there. I tried to figure out what is their next move, if they are comfortable going into this cloud or if they have a clever way, but I couldn't see much. Just everyone taking a short break and then quickly disappearing in the nothingness. 
I forced a smile on my face to take a selfie, put my jacket on my sweaty shirt real quick and then hit the road as well.  
I'll be honest, it was scary, the visibility was about 3-5m, I never pulled my brakes so hard before. I think I averaged some 30kph going down on a pass. It was really cold too.
Anyways, from like halfway one the clouds were gone and it became really pleasant again. By the time I got to Innertkirchen I was ready for the 2nd climb. I took a quick brake to refill my bottles and have a bite. I went into a small supermarket next to a (or more like he main) square. There were so many cyclists around there, it was such a joy to see them. Some alone some in groups, men and women alike, I love this. 

After 20ish minutes I started the 2nd climb: Grimselpass. 10/10, not as steep as Susten, but plenty long, with beautiful views and some really quiet sections on dedicated cycling roads. I even met some people I know, coming from the opposite direction! What a small world! And I love the view of the Hospice in the middle of the lake near the top.
I took another ~20m brake to refill the bottles and to have a coffee and continued my way down.

This descent was much more pleasant: not a single cloud this time. There is only one tricky part near the end of the descent: in Oberwald the road (and the Strava heatmap) goes into a big tunnel that has a big sign: no cyclists.
It got me pretty confused and made me spend some time looking for an alternative, I didn't want to yolo it. 
For everyone that has the same confusion there: just a couple hundred meters before the tunnel, cross the railway tracks. It will lead to a nice and wide bike road. Very pleasant. So I was ready for climb 3.

By the time I got to the Nufenenpass I was getting pretty tired. I barely averaged over 180W for the Grimselpass, but I wasn't feeling rested. The views compensated for my pain, but I started dragging myself near the end. I was so happy to see the sign on the top.

I had to take a longer break there, because I felt like my legs will cramp, I was really running low on energy, on the edge of bonking. I bought a salty chips in the kiosk on the top, and some snickers, and some powerade and coke.  
20 minutes later I had to get going. I felt better again and I knew I have to keep moving because it will get dark on me if I waste too much time.  I was hesitating if I should start the 4th climb or just look for a train in Airolo.  
I was close to doing that. I wanted to take at least another break there, to buy more food and drinks. 

To my luck, I missed the turn to the city and when I noticed, I was already climbing up on the Gotthard pass. I did take a break there though, just on the side of the road. I really needed the energy, so I ate and drank whatever I had left and kept going.

It was painful, but with ups and downs. Luckily the roads were mostly empty. The start slowly started setting, I've seen some campers getting ready for the night, so I knew I had no time to waste.

Made it, I was gone, I was dead, but I still had to get down to Goeschenen to catch the train home. So I opted to take the fast road instead of the Tremola and quickly flew back down to Andermatt and then further. Really fast descent the whole way. More cars, especially after Andermatt, but I made it with 20m to spare for my train.

My phone's battery was dying really hard, and I wanted to by one of those chimpy power banks from the vending machine. To my misfortune it got stuck. :(

Oh well, I was with my own thoughts all day, almost 10 hours of riding, 11 and a half with the breaks. Another hour on the train will not change my sanity much. I even talked to some guys who did the same, I was just 15 minutes faster haha. They laughed at me for doing it on my aero bike. Well, I don't have a climbing bike, so that's it.

Cheers!
