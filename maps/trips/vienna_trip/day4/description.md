The night was short. I completely forgot about the Daylight Saving Time switch, only noticed that it was still dark outside. Never mind I thought, at least I’ll have more time to get to Vienna. I packed rather quickly and hit the road again. The Austrian part of the bike path is even more separated from the regular roads than the German. I was looking for a bakery or petrol station to grab some breakfast along the way, but it was strictly going by the river, not really crossing any villages for the first hour of riding, so I had to find something in Linz already. With a little detour I found a petrol station and stopped there for a sandwich. 

The road outside of the city was a bit tricky, after a too sharp turn I almost ended up on a highway. :sweat_smile:
This is one of the reasons why I like to start so early in the mornings. The cities are empty, I can make mistakes.

This day for a change the wind was not directly in my face, rather a crosswind, but also even stronger. Meteo blue said 60km/h. It indeed felt crazy.

Around 10 in the morning I felt quite tired again, I stopped for some snacking next to a big sign that said that the road is closed. It explicitly said that it is even closed for cyclists. By the time i finished my chocolate multiple cyclists looked at the sign and kept going at the same direction, so I thought maybe they know something, let me risk it again. Oh well.

But maybe it was my luck. On the way back I’ve seen another bikepacker flying towards the closed bridge, so I shouted at him “es ist gesperrt”. He turned around and we started chatting, he said that he is also going to Vienna so we decided to stick together. At first we talked in german, he spoke really clearly - unlike people in switzerland - but a bit too fast for my broken B1, so after a while we switched to english. Unlike my Mad Max friend from the previous day, he had a really serious gravel bike. Fully equipped with aero bars, bottles behind the seat post, bags in the fork and back wheel. I wish I took a picture, it looked really good. 
He is a mechanical engineer by day, but used to be a sniper in the military, felt like he knew all about being stealth in the forests. Pretty hard core guy, he was also sleeping in his tent. He gave me some good advice on sleeping bags and equipment, I’m really tempted to go on a more wild adventure the next time and leave the comfort of the hotel rooms behind. I’m only concerned about the recovery, if i can rest well enough for such rides on the next days. He said that he was woken up by a deer barking at his tent. But maybe I simply won’t ride that much. Or something. Not sure what else to do, I’m not gonna visit museums in my clipping shoes and stinky cycling clothes that’s for sure. I’m happy to hear any tips in the comments (instagram or something).
Anyways, nice talks, nice scenery, the time was flying. We weren’t so fast because of the winds but made some steady progress. In the region of Wachau which is famous for it’s apricots and apricot products we made a quick stop in a really cute little village. Had a cheese and dried plum sandwich, some sweet pastry and my first traditional Austrian Melange. In Hungary Melange is often some really sweet milk coffee with honey or something, maybe even condensed milk. I learned that the real Melange is part coffee, milk and milk foam. What’s the difference between this and a Cappuccino you might ask? Cappuccino is made with an espresso and Melange is with longer black coffee, making it a bit lighter and creamier. 
We were sitting there for a good half an hour before hitting the windy road again.

Roughly 60-70kms before Vienna the winds were getting even crazier. At this point we were not really talking anymore, just fighting our way forward. He called quits. His bike was wider from the bags, not so aero as my ass rocket. He said that he will just get to the next town and take the train from there instead. I still wanted to make it to Vienna on my own and I had good chances, so we said good bye, shared contacts, and I started pushing. 
He texted me later around 2am, that after a long break he felt strong again and made it even further - to his home town after Vienna, counting 305kms for the day. Crazy!

I just tried to stay as aero as possible and kept pushing. It wasn’t so much fun and I have my first memories of my ribs seriously hurting from these times. Probably as I had to counter the 60km/h crosswind I had more pressure on my sides. I was slowly running out of energy - and gummy bears, so I desperately needed a pit stop. No stores on Sunday though and I haven’t found a single petrol station either. Until I got to Tulln. Nicely built out beach by the river, with extremely good infrastructure for cyclists! And by that I mean a water fountain, public toilette and a little Segafredo cafe that sells sandwiches, energy gels and poweraid as well! At first I thought it is a mirage! :grinning:

I loaded up and I was ready for the last 30-40kms.

One last detour due to some constructions. I tried to follow a guy to hide behind him from the wind, but he was really fast, and when he saw that I was behind him, he started pedalling even faster, so it didn’t last long. Pretty much the first guy that was faster than me the entire trip. Previously I had some cyclists sitting on my wheels for a couple of kms silently. They said thank you and bye when the turned another way and that was it. Maybe I looked too dangerous to this guy, it’s fine.

Approaching the city I felt happier snd happier. The wind was still strong, but I felt how close I am to my goal that I’ve been chasing for almost a 1000kms. City cycling is still really slow. The last 5kms took half an hour because of all the red lights.

But I finally made it to the hotel. My Mom was waiting for me there with a friend of hers. I was really happy! :slightly_smiling_face:

Tired but satisfied, stinky but proud. I took a shower and we went to have some dinner. The next day some sightseeing and then back to Zürich with the night train. 
What a journey! I will never forget it.
