## Description
The source of the Danube is in Donaueschingen, which is only 85km away from Zurich!
There is a little climb after Schaffhausen, so by the Rhein fall is a perfect location for a first stop.
After the hill is already Germany, but there are no big borders, gates or police, the only thing that gives it away is the sign on the license plates. The road to the source - which is represented by a very nicely built out well - goes through some small villages until it finally reaches the Danube. Donaueschingen is a small (~5km) detour from the rest of the trip, but it’s definitely worth it, if for nothing else, just the fact that one has been there. :slightly_smiling_face: There are also some cafes, stores and even a bike shop, for some last minute purchases there!

The source of the Danube is in Donaueschingen, which is only 85km away from Zurich! The cycling path goes all the way to the Black sea, but this day my goal was only to Ulm. I knew about this trail for a long time, since I ~~wrote~~ copied a homework to some “free credit” subject about the Danube back in the University. I was playing with the thought for a long time to go to at least to Budapest or maybe further along it, but it is not so easy to organise such things. Lately I was looking for destinations, where could I go with a bike in a long weekend, where I could just simply take the train back from, and this seemed to be the perfect choice. There are direct trains back even from Budapest. I only had 4 days though, as I didn’t want to take a 10 hour train directly, tired, hungry, dirty. So I decided that Vienna it is. But step by step, first: Ulm.


I’ve packed my bike the night before and slept about 5 hours until I woke up at 5:00. I wanted to be on my way by 6:00 because I was scared that there won’t be enough daylight to do the 260kms that I planned for this day. I had a quick breakfast, got dressed in all of my clothes, as it was 3C that morning and I was already on my way. 

I knew that I had some challenges waiting for me - other than the fact that I’m about to cycle almost 1000kms in 4 days alone. This extra challenge was the forecasted rain in the morning hours. At 6 it was all good, but from 8-11 meteoswiss showed some drizzling. I knew that if I take a 3 hours long break there is no way I make it to Ulm, so I was ready to cycle through it. I though that my water repellent layers will hold for about an hour and when it will get really bad, I’ll just stop in a bakery to warm up.

Unfortunately I was pretty wrong. As soon as I left Schaffhausen, instead of drizzling, it started to rain properly. At the beginning it wasn’t too bad though, my clothes held up, and I was climbing through a hill, so it was even somewhat pleasant. As I got closer the the peak however the rain slowly faded into a snow storm and then to hail. At that point it wasn’t pleasant anymore, I was wet and cold. There is one thing however that is worse than climbing with a heavy bike in the hail. Going downhill in the hail. The cold wind of the fast speed got my face and my fingers through my wet gloves frozen. My glasses started fogging up from the inside, and on the outside it was full of rain. As I don’t have a windshield wiper on them, I tried to pull them down a little so that I can at least see the road. That very second a small piece if ice hit my eye, so bad that I couldn’t open it again for minutes. The whole trip was turning into a comedy at this point, I was just laughing at myself, why am I doing all this again?! Though I made it down from the hill, my fingers were really frozen, I wanted to stop in a bakery or petrol station or something as soon as possible. The road was leading me through some small villages, pretty silent ones. The first one had nothing, so I stopped to check the map for something. It said that there was one bakery in the next village so I decided to go for it. Unfortunately it was’t there, or I was blind, but without any further ado, I kept cycling. Next village empty again, the one after too. I kept shaking my hands and do some Bear Grylls windmills with it to keep the blood flowing to my fingers, but i wasn’t really feeling them at this point. I was afraid that I won’t be able to pull the brakes anymore. :see_no_evil: Especially my damaged fingers were not responsive anymore, which got me pretty worried.

I stopped in the next village to ask some road workers if there is a bakery or something in here. They said no, but there is one in the next one! Perfect I thought. For 2 reasons: 1, I barely crossed the border to Germany and I can already understand the people here lol and 2, there is a hope to save my fingers from amputation and my body from hypothermia. As soon as I got to the village I jumped off of the bike to check where the bakery was, I didn’t even think about the fact that my wet frozen gloves won’t really work well with the touch screen. As soon as I got the phone out of the pocket I looked up and noticed the Bäckerei sign right in front of me. I didn’t hesitate for a second, just went right there, left the bike in front of the store, I didn’t even lock it, just tore the door open and stormed in like a (something stormy). I asked for something and a cappuccino and went directly to the restroom. I could squeeze 2dls of fresh glacier water from each of my gloves. I also found the reason why my damaged fingers were more frozen. I was wearing the compression sleeves on them that the doctor gave me. They were also totally wet and frozen. It did hurt to put under warm water, but luckily a few minutes later they were all good again. I stayed in the bakery for over an hour, slowly stopped the shivering and warmed up enough to keep going. The rain stopped on the meanwhile, so I didn’t need my rain protection anymore. Which was fortunate, because I had some other warm clothes to change to, but no 2nd set of rain protection. I only lacked one thing: gloves. And it was still too cold to ride without gloves. Not to mention that these long distance rides can really damage the palms without cycling gloves, and they are really handy in case of accidents too! 
So I decided to get a new pair in Donaueschingen. I know I know, after all this I didn’t HAVE to do the detour to the source but come on. If I do this whole trip i’d be mad at myself forever not to properly start it at the source. So I went for it. And got the gloves. And then the sun. And all the good vibes with it. I was whistling, I was singing, debating with myself if i’m stupid or just happy. I did feel happy! I even had some wind on my back!

I had time, so I was reading my messages. A few of my friends and family texted me to wish me good luck on the trip, it felt really really good. It gave me power to keep pedalling. I had one more short brake in a bakery, but otherwise I was just sending it, up until a very mean turn on the last 30kms. There were gravel piled on the middle of the road at a Y turn. As I was looking at my GPS to see which way to go, while pulling the brakes to slow down, I haven’t noticed the pebbles. My thin wheels had no traction and I found myself on the ground. Again.

I checked my fingers first if they are all right and then the rest of my body. I was so happy that (except for the torn gloves, pants and overshoes) everything was intact I even took a selfie. 

I kept cycling then and made it to Ulm in the hotel with plenty of daylight left. I had to take my bike to the hotel underground garage, which was steep and slippery. I tried walking down in my clippy shoes, and of course slipped with the bike. Just one more thing for this day. I don’t even know if I felt more sorry for my bike or for myself at this point. Anyways, I unpacked the bike and checked in.

I was happy I made it but still scared. Rain, crash, my knee did bleed and hurt a bit. What if it will get worse by tomorrow? What if I got sick? What if my legs won’t take me further? I didn’t give up though. I ordered 2 pizzas, took a shower, washed the blood out of my pants, massages my legs, had a quick call with friends and prepared everything for the next day.

**Update 2024-04-09**: I broke a rib lol.
