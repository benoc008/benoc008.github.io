## Description
The bike trails along the German and Austrian parts of the Danube are of one of the best quality bike roads I’ve seen to date. Most of the route goes through wide paved roads that are well signed and really easy to follow. There is not much elevation, so in shorter sections I would recommend it for beginners as well.

There are some gravel sections, which I personally don’t like, so I planned my routes on Strava to send me through proper roads instead. I don’t mind riding with cars and the drivers were always very careful anyways. 

My personal favourite was the section from the German-Austrian border to Linz. Beautiful scenery with hills, forests and camping sites.

One thing I found unusual compared to my previous cycling trips was the lack of frequent water/snack sources. As most of the route is a dedicated bike path along the Danube, it avoids cities and villages as much as possible. Therefore  don’t expect a petrol station every few kms. They are jot far though, just plan with the detours if you do this trip.

### The day before starting
I’ll be honest, I’m pretty scared. I couldn’t sleep last night already and I’m sure I’ll take a big dose of melatonin tonight as well, maybe something harder too. I’m about to attempt 4 rides back to back that will all end up in my top 5 longest ones to date. Why am I doing all this? Do I want to prove something? To myself? Or am I seeking for external validation when I share it? I don’t even know myself, but I’ll be proud as hell if I manage. And it will be a pretty good training for all the shit I signed up for the rest of the year.

I planned again only 3-4 days in advance. I could have spent more time with it, but I also kind of trust myself, this won’t be my first trip anyways. Not even the first one alone. Riding through foreign lands and especially during easter however - when everything is closed - gives me some anxiety. What if my bike breaks? What if I won’t find food or drinks? What if I get sick in the cold and the rain? I guess only one way to find out. :grinning:

And I did find it out, but I suggest to read the blog posts of the sections before coming back to my conclusion! :wink:

### After the trip

I did it. Phew, it feels good! 4 days, 963kms, 4537m elevation, 38.5h riding, 3 bags of gummy bears, 8 energy bars, 3 gels, 3 snickers’ and countless pastries later I’ve made it to Vienna!
It was beautiful, I’m really proud of myself. It was a training, a therapy, an adventure. I’ve seen new places, met new people and challenged myself in ways I haven’t before. I’m not saying that this trip completely changed me, of course not. But I’m also not the same Bence as the one that “stepped” into the Danube at Donaueschingen. :smile:
I’m one of those creepy homeless looking guys now that sit alone in restaurants, haha. :grinning:

As I’m writing this, I’m sitting in a restaurant near the train station, waiting for my departure time to come. I’m in quite some pain, but it really is not as bad as I thought it would be. I feel some soreness when I walk up/down the stairs and I have some pain in my ribs - which I assume is from holding the bike against crosswinds all day yesterday. Otherwise I’m just a little bit sleepy, but when I close my eyes I still see the road running in front of me. :see_no_evil:

#### Takeaways
2 years ago when I started cycling I was dead after riding for 80kms. Our first cycling trip averaged way less than 100k/day. Last year when we did 480kms in 3 days along the Rhein I was completely destroyed by the end. Now this trip physically felt surprisingly easy compared to those. My legs were spinning with no major pain, my butt was feeling all right and I wasn’t really exhausted at any point. This is probably partially due to the many small improvements, like getting a proper bikefitting, nee shoes, being more prepared with clothing and nutrition, etc.. But most importantly the consistent training. I think this is the biggest key learning to me. Even without a focused and structured training plan, just by regularly doing it, one can make great improvements in endurance training. Especially if they start from 0.

Of course not everything was perfect though, I see the room for improvement. As of the equipment, I will get thicker wheels for the next time to make the ride more comfortable and more solid. And for my body, I still definitely need some improvements in my nutrition plan. I’ve read how important it is to keep eating carbs on such occasions, but my body was not prepared for so many gummy bears. I even threw up at night after I arrived to Vienna.

This trip was also challenging in new ways. Riding alone all day, especially in these windy days can get one’s mind into places. Let’s say it was therapeutic. When riding with others, I was always looking forward to the little stops to chat, to look after each other or to share our experiences in the evenings after the rides. But this time I also didn’t have to only rely on myself either. I was afraid that even though I brought 2 spare inner tubes, I wouldn’t be able to replace them, because of my damaged fingers :see-no:evil:. But 1, I didn’t have to and 2, people were nice along the way. When I fell for example a guy stopped a few minutes after even though he didn’t even see the crash, I just till had the bike in the middle of the road. During the days I made some friends and in the evenings, I was chatting to friends or my Mom over the phone. :) So I wasn’t that alone actually!

I would 100% do it again. Or rather something similar, but bigger and longer and maybe somewhere else, I’m happy to hear your suggestions! (But first I’m gonna give my poor bike a good wash! :see_no_evil:)

Thank you for everyone who followed me on this trip and who read the posts!

**Update**: The adventures were not over yet haha. Turns out they sent a smaller train than the number of tickets they sold. The inspector said that I have two choices: either I stay in Vienna or sit on the train floor. Luckily back when I lived and worked in Germany as a consultant I got used to sitting on the train floor as DB regularly had this issue. :see_no_evil: So look at my bed for the night:

At least I got to stay by mine bike. :grinning:

**Update2**: I broke a rib when I fell from the bike on the 1st day lol.
