I was really excited for this day, as - according to the plans - I was finally arriving to Austria. I’ve never really been there before. (Technically I was once, on a company ski trip some 7 years ago, but we were only travelling to this village over night and I wasn’t skiing in the end because the instructor didn’t come.)

I started riding at 6:30 and had breakfast soon after in a little village bakery. Unlike the day before (and after) on Saturday the stores were open in Germany, so I was not worried getting food. At 10 I already had to take a break in an Edeka parking lot. I felt extremely tired and sleepy, I just wanted to lay on the ground and take a nap. A ~~bit~~ lot of sugar helped as always. My stomach was already burning of my sugar diet, so apart of gummy bears and coke I also bought a smoothie, a banana and instead of snickers I loaded up on some oat bars.
I haven’t notices before, but probably when I fell on the first day I also lost the end plug from my handlebar and the tape was already unwinding. So I also took the opportunity and tried to fix it. I wanted to get electricians tape, but i could only find Leukoplast, which looked as if my bike had an injury, but it did the job, so I was really satisfied with my bike repair skills. As I rolled it around I noticed a little pink hairband on the floor, probably a little girl lost it. Well it’s mine now - I thought - and I put it on my injured bike as a lucky token. :slightly_smiling_face:

After I regained my energy I kept riding. The wind was the same as the day before. Constant 30-40km/h headwind, so even though it wasn’t that cold anymore, I was wearing long sleeves and my buff around the face as wind protection.

On the way I faced a couple of road blocks that I could always just get around by pushing my bike for a few meters or lifting it over the road blocks. It was the weekend, no one was there, what could go wrong…

A little bit later I met a fellow cyclist on the road. He asked something from me that I don’t even remember and then we just kept chatting for the next 1-1.5 hours. He was riding an old, rusty and heavy looking bike, packed with panniers, a whole big pump hanging out of one. He was wearing a medical mask against the wind. He looked a bit like as if he just escaped from Mad Max, pretty rad. Turns out he was studying in Regensburg and was basically on his weekend commute to Passau. A good ~140kms? We weren’t moving too fast and instead of taking the hilly main roads that I planned to avoid some gravel sections, we stayed on the official path. With his sandmobil it was fine I guess, it is still not my favourite though.

After Passau I knew I had to fire up the rockets. The morning was a bit slow and also this chatty section, I was still on time, but no room for long stops or mistakes. Leaving Passau I had my first near-accident with a pedestrian. I find shared walking/cycling roads often quite dangerous. Even though the surface was perfect and it was also plenty wide for everyone, pedestrians often still don’t expect cyclists on these roads. They walk next to each other, occupying the entire width of the path. Shouting or ringing the bell on them actually makes things worse, because they will jump, but only god knows in which direction. And then they just turn around and stop looking at you like a deer to the headlights, but still in the middle of the road. So when I feel that there is enough space to pass safely, I just do it. Silently. This time a guy was stepping pretty much right in front of me, without looking. I felt that my handlebar hit the sleeve of his jacket, but nothing serious. He was shouting at me as if I was wrong, I looked back, all was good, so I just kept pushing.

I did some last round of shopping and I refilled my bottles in a Netto near the border, but it was really just a quick stop.

Crossing the border was again not so visible, I haven’t even noticed a single welcome to Austria table. What I’ve noticed is a pretty nice little park for the Danube bike path, with signs and shops and stuff. I just kept going however, it was getting late and I still had a good ~60?km until Linz. 

This was my favourite part of the entire trip. Really good quality roads and beautiful scenery. After Passau where the Inn and the Isar? joined the Danube it was already pretty much as big as I remember it from Budapest. The mountains/hills around were not as monumental as the ones in the Alps, but still really beautiful. I had a long downhill between the hills and forests all the way to the river, where people were doing picnics, camping, fishing and playing on the fields for many kms long. And I could just fly by them (except for the headwind) as the road was really really good. 

Little did I know another surprise was waiting for me. A guy already stopped me a few kms before to tell me that the road is closed. I stopped to look at the map for alternatives, but there was nothing I really liked, so I decided to keep going and try my luck again as I did multiple times already on this trip, maybe I can just climb over the block.

Unfortunately I ran out of luck. :shrug: They really made sure that no one can cross this with a bike.

I had to turn around and go back 5-6kms until the next crossroads. I met the previous guy and a small group by him there. I asked if they know any other routes, but apparently the only one was to cross the hill. It was already 5pm and sunset was around 6:30 and I had more than 30kms to go, across the hill? No idea. The other guys decided to call a taxi. I decided to try through the hill.

Climbing wasn’t that bad, all day was pretty flat otherwise, so I was happy for the change, I kept smiling the entire time. I already did more than 200kms this day at this point, so I started to feel my knee a bit, but nothing too serious. The view from the top and the downhill was really rewarding, maybe even better this way! :slightly_smiling_face:

The rest of the way to Linz was pretty flat, by the river again. At one point I turned on my lights to stay visible, but it only got completely dark by the time I arrived to the hotel in the city center. 
I’m glad I didn’t have to ride more in the dark. I have a decent light but the small bumps and potholes or the dirt/gravel on the road was still hard to notice. I prefer riding during the day.

The city was cute and quite living, I’ve seen a lot of young people walking around. The hotel was also really nice, but since it was already later than I planned, I just took a shower and had some mediocre overpriced dinner in the first restaurant next to it and then fell asleep. 

One more day to Vienna.
