I set my alarm to 5:30, even though I knew that I’ll still have to pack my bike. I just felt like I needed more sleep. Since hotel breakfast was only from 7:30 I opted out of that. I had a half of a pizza from last night that I slowly stuffed into my sleepy face instead. Got dressed, packed the bike and I was on my merry way, wearing all of my clothes again, because - according to the weather app - it was 1C in the morning. After only about 2 hours of riding it was drizzling again, but this time I was smarter and stopped at the first petrol station. I loaded up my snickers and gummy bear reserves, had a sandwich and some sweet pastry, sugary coke, coffee and by the time I was done, the rain stopped and I was riding again. From here on it was a pretty uneventful day, with some crazy headwinds. Meteoblue said 30-40km/h directly in my face. Pretty soul crushing after so many hours to be honest. I was pedalling and barely moving, the wind noise was giving me a headache and it was also getting my skin pretty dry. I was counting back the kms. I took a little stop in Ingolstadt, the city I thought I would never return to after working there for 8 months. This time it was surprisingly pleasant though, I found a nice bakery, hidden from the winds, the sun was shining, I got a bit of energy back there.

As I was approaching Regensburg I finally started seeing some cyclists. Until this point I’ve only met a handful of old dudes, riding those heavily packed e-bikes with the paniers, as if they were taking their entire home with themselves. But here I’ve seen some other tourers and also people riding their regular lightweight racing bikes. I’ve even seen an elderly couple riding hand in hand, really cute!

I’ve arrived to Regensburg with plenty of daylight again and the hotel had a nice restaurant too, so I was not worried. I wasn’t that hungry yet actually (maybe eating gummy bears all day indeed helps) so after a quick shower I called my Mom and we were chatting while I was doing my laundry. And by doing the laundry I mean hand washing the sweaty, muddy, bloody cycling clothes with shower gel that I’ve been wearing for 2 days at this point. Previously I used to carry a little bottle of detergent (~1dl) but this time to save weight and most importantly space, I opted out of that. I had to carry many layers on this trip, so I was trying to be really conscious about the volume of my luggage. It all worked out fine in the end.
To make sure my clothes dry by the morning I usually squeeze them well and then wrap them in a dry towel and twist them together so the towel soaks up most of the leftover moisture. But just to be on the aafe side, I’ve let the AC run as well while I was having dinner, that also takes the moisture out of the air. Since it was one of those card operated hotel rooms, I had to leave my health insurance card in the holder to make sure the electricity (and with that the AC) keeps running in the room haha. 
After the dinner I was also blasting it for a little with the hair dryer and then it seemed to be fine to finish drying by the morning.

Then I fell asleep.
