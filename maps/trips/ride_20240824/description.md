(Writing months later.)

We had only one week before the famous Tour Des Stations - which we were all clearly afraid of and unprepared for. 7000m of climbing in 200km, a very long day.
The plan was to save whatever we can and do one last big ride. Well, that was the other's plan, I had a birthday party to attend in the evening, so I knew I'll cut this ride short as well.

Their plan was the following: Furka, Nufenen, Gotthard and then optionally Susten in the end. As a tapering ride.
I kind of hoped for doing the first 3, but was deep down ready to take the train already from Airolo before starting the Gotthardpass.

That's exactly what's happened, I bought some wine in Airolo and let the others finish their taper.
