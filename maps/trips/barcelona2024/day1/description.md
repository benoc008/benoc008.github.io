Riding in Barcelona as in most big cities is a bit tedious. Full of red lights, disappearing and reappearing bike lanes, detours because of constructions, etc.. But once I was out of the city I found good quality empty roads between villages and industrial areas (e.g. the airport), but the drivers were careful even on busier roads as well. I was not afraid to ride these roads at all (unlike some roads in Italy for example).
They jump red lights however. Pedestrians, cyclists, and I think sometimes cars too. Kind of expected.

Scenic places have stops, signed with "Mirador", and villages have nice cafes.

I haven't slept much, but as soon as my alarm set off I felt ready to go cycling!
Except for a few small things that I had to take care of beforehand, but I already had a plan! First, go to Decathlon to buy shower slippers, because I forgot mine at home. Then go to the rental to pick up my bike and on the way, find some breakfast. Perfect!

Everything went smoothly to the point when I tried to clarify the return time of the Bike. I wanted to take it until Sunday evening, but it turned out that they are not open on Sunday and have no way to return the bike before Monday 10am when they open. Unfortunately my flight was at 9:50, so that was not an option for me. The bike guy started panicking: "but... but... you reserved until Monday 10am, it was in the contract, we can't give your money back, it's all your fault.". But once he understood that i'm not worried about the money and I'm not trying to blame anyone here, just ride the bike for 3 days, he became calm and supportive. He remembered, that they actually have a bike pickup/delivery service, and they can pick up the bike from the hostel on Monday. Perfect I thought, I had to pay some extra, but problem solved. I was just waiting for his confirmation that the courier is available. Took the bike back to the hostel, changed my clothes and finally started my ride!

Riding in big cities is rarely fun, Barcelona is no exception. Red light to red light, bike lanes disappearing and then reappearing, heavy traffic. I lost the track that I planned a few times already at the beginning, but it was all right. The people there seemed to be really laid back, so I also didn't stress much about riding on the wrong lanes / sidewalks. I stopped a couple of times for selfies, I was just so happy to finally ride the bike outdoors after 4 months of winter break. The weather was perfect, not too cold, not too warm, not a single cloud.

After an hour I found myself in an industrial area which was closed due to a construction. I still managed to go around and get on the road with my bicycle. the whole 2 lanes were mine, I felt free as a bird.

I really wanted to have lunch by the sea and I was getting pretty hungry at this point, so after a little climbing I was descending to the shore like Tom Pidcock. Full gas no breaks. Or at least that's how I felt, the GPS said at the end that I was barely going 60km/h. :sweat_smile:

Made it though! At the beach of Sitges multiple busy restaurants offered lunch, and the waitress in a cool looking one without questions offered me a table with a spot right next to it for my bike! I had a nice sandwich there with a beautiful espresso and enjoyed the atmosphere for around half an hour before I continued my way back to Barcelona through some hills!
