## Description

**Distance:** 117.88km   
**Elevation:** 1,222m

Riding in Barcelona as in most big cities is a bit tedious. Full of red lights, disappearing and reappearing bike lanes, detours because of constructions, etc.. But once I was out of the city I found good quality empty roads between villages and industrial areas (e.g. the airport), and the drivers were careful even on busier roads as well. I was not afraid to ride these roads at all (unlike some roads in Italy for example).  
They jump red lights however. Pedestrians, cyclists, and I think sometimes cars too. Kind of expected.

**Trains in Spain**  
Since it was a really last minute trip, I didn't do my research about bikes on trains in Spain until I arrived. I learned there that on the fast trains (AVE and friends) bikes can only be transported in bags. It was a bummer, because I had one at home. On slow trains bikes are fine though, and free of costs. 

Scenic places have stops, signed with "Mirador", and villages have nice cafes.

### Preparation
I haven't slept much, but as soon as my alarm set off I felt ready to go cycling!  
Except for a few small things that I had to take care of beforehand, but I already had a plan! First, go to Decathlon to buy shower slippers, because I forgot mine at home. Then go to the rental to pick up my bike and on the way, find some breakfast. Perfect!

Everything went smoothly to the point when I tried to clarify the return time of the Bike. I wanted to take it until Sunday evening, but it turned out that they are not open on Sunday and have no way to return the bike before Monday 10am when they open. Unfortunately my flight was at 9:50, so that was not an option for me. The bike guy started panicking: "but... but... you reserved until Monday 10am, it was in the contract, we can't give your money back, it's all your fault.". But once he understood that i'm not worried about the money and I'm not trying to blame anyone here, just ride the bike for 3 days, he became calm and supportive. He remembered, that they actually have a bike pickup/delivery service, and they can pick up the bike from the hostel on Monday. Perfect I thought, I had to pay some extra, but problem solved. I was just waiting for his confirmation that the courier is available. Took the bike back to the hostel, changed my clothes and finally started my ride!


### The ride
Riding in big cities is rarely fun, Barcelona is no exception. Red light to red light, bike lanes disappearing and then reappearing, heavy traffic. I lost the track that I planned a few times already at the beginning, but it was all right. The people there seemed to be really laid back, so I also didn't stress much about riding on the wrong lanes / sidewalks. I stopped a couple of times for selfies, I was just so happy to finally ride the bike outdoors after 4 months of winter break. The weather was perfect, not too cold, not too warm, not a single cloud.

After an hour I found myself in an industrial area which was closed due to a construction. I still managed to go around and get on the road with my bicycle. The whole 2 lanes were mine, I felt free as a bird.

I really wanted to have lunch by the sea and I was getting pretty hungry at this point, so after a little climbing I was descending to the shore like Tom Pidcock. Full gas no breaks. Or at least that's how I felt, the GPS said at the end that I was barely going 60km/h. :sweat_smile:

Made it though! At the beach of Sitges multiple busy restaurants offered lunch, and the waitress in a cool looking one without questions offered me a table with a spot right next to it for my bike! I had a nice sandwich there with a beautiful espresso and enjoyed the atmosphere for around half an hour before I continued my way back to Barcelona through some hills!

I googled for group rides in Barcelona, and found a small meetup for this day. I was hoping to join it, but unfortunately I was still far at the time they started. No regrets though. I really can't describe the feeling of riding in perfect weather, pain and stress free. No pressure to keep up with the group, no one giving me rude comments if I need multiple stops or if I take too much time eating. I was smiling all day, can you tell? :grinning:

### Afternoon
Since I had some extra time until sunset (because I missed the group ride) I decided to go for a quick run as well and went directly to the beach. Oh my god, the city was so crowded. :grinning: And the red lights and construction works, it was more like an interval session than an actual run. I'm still glad I went.

Once I got back to the hostel I finally took a well deserved shower - after 2 days. :sweat_smile: I was a little bit nervous as I recently had a small skin surgery and I was supposed to put some anti biotic cream on the wound - and the hostel hygiene was not on the top. But in the end all was good.  
I also made my bed properly and packed all my clothes and stuff for the evening, the next morning and for cycling.

I wanted to go to Girona, had a nice plan to take the train there. Ride up to Figueres to check out Dali's birth place and then hit the mountains. Unfortunately my plan was pretty half-baked. Fast trains in Spain only take bikes in bags (which I had at home, not here) and slow trains only operated like twice per day to Girona, and none back. A bummer, but I didn't go too hard on myself for it, it was a last minute journey, I quickly planned another route around Barcelona.  
All I had left for the day was to grab some food.

### Evening surprise
The hostel organised free dinners. I'm fortunate enough to be able to pay for my food, but I decided to join them for the company. I booked a hostel bed to meet people after all. :shrug: 

Beautiful mushroom pasta. I only took a little though, as I was starving and didn't want to shamelessly eat the whole pot of free pasta. I wanted to grab some more food somewhere else later instead.

We were 7 people at the table at the beginning, half of them hostel workers / volunteers, the others guests. Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Lithuania, US and myself Mr. Hungary. After the food the group quickly shrunk to the 3 of us with Mr. Lithuania and Ms. US. Lithuania already had 1 too many beers and was pitching us the latest local drug trend: Mephedrone with Fentanil. "The best feeling ever. Like it's your birthday and everyone around you is only there to celebrate you." Interesting :shrug:. He (not so quickly) realised that we were not amused though and left for another beer.

From this point on the time was flying. We were chatting about life, work, balance (or the lack of it), hustling, future plans, etc.. Such a pleasant conversation. I was a little bit afraid that I was boring her, because to be honest, with the lack of sleep and all day sports I wasn't in my brightest state. In spite of all that she suggested to join her for a gelato and dinner the next evening, which I gladly accepted. I only then realised that it was already midnight, I haven't had a proper dinner and I wanted to wake up early. Never mind, I went out for a sandwich and a protein drink to the corner 24/7 and then directly to sleep. This night I had no issues with it. :sweat_smile:

The journey continues the next day!
