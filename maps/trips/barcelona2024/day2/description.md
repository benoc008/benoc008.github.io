I was getting the hang of this whole hostel thing, though I woke up a bit before my alarm, I felt fresh. I already had everything I needed in the morning prepared: cycling clothes, toothbrush, banana for breakfast, my electrolytes, etc., so I could get ready without any noise.  

On my way out I managed to find the receptionist guy at his place, so I tried to give him a little heads up, that someone will pick up my rental bike a Monday morning. I wasn’t even asking really, just out of politeness. The place is called Bed and Bike after all, I thought that they were prepared for people with bicycles around. I was wrong. 
The dude was pretty rude, when he first said no I thought that he was joking. Then he explained to me that he can’t take the responsibility for the bike for 2 hours. What if they won't come, he will have to take it back blah blah. I didn't quite understand, I had the contract - both for the rental and the pickup - and also the safety deposit. Then I thought that I know what's the problem and tried to offer him some compensation for his troubles, like we would do on the wild wild east. But it didn't work, i think he was just simply very lazy. :slightly_frowning_face: 

After 10 minutes of arguing I gave up and realised that I’ll have to return the bike today. I’ll be honest, it didn’t feel so good, kind of ruined my morning. I felt like a failure that I go on my first holiday alone and I can’t even take care of the bike properly. By the time I got out of the city I made peace with myself. I planned the whole trip in less than 24 hours in advance, this is part of it if I want to be so spontaneous. And I already had my plan B: go for a long run on Sunday!

I was so much in my head, as I came to this conclusion I realised that I forgot to stop for breakfast. I wasn’t that hungry so I just kept spinning. First a little hill above the city with a great view, then some downhills, parks, industrial areas and villages.

At this point my stomach started calling for help and I had to eat one of my energy bars to keep my mood high. I also stopped to check the map and set a bakery as my new destination.

To be honest, leaving the rental bike on the street in a foreign country made me a bit anxious. This was the first time during my trip that i wished I wasn’t alone, so someone can look after my bike. But I quickly pushed these thoughts away, I’m a big boy, I can figure it out. So I just left the bike unlocked right in front of the door lol. : sweat_smile : I kept one eye on it though. Everyone in the bakery was so kind to me - even that I didn’t speak any Spanish and they didn’t speak any English, we figured it all out while sharing genuine warm smiles.

After loading up on 2 diabetes worth of sugars, I hit the road again with fresh energy! This was the point when I realised just how many cyclists are out there. On Friday not so much - I guess most people work on Fridays, but Saturday they were all around the place: cities, climbs, middle aged and younger, solo and groups. It was very pleasant to see such a vivid cycling scene. No women though, I think I’ve seen at least 100 cyclists this day, and only 1 of them was a woman. Or they are still so obsessed with the old “legs: shaved, arms: shaved, face: hairy” trend that they were wearing fake beards just to look like Peter Sagan. :shrug:

I climbed through some beautiful hills and had some short descents. I really enjoy how different the vegetation compared to Switzerland is. On one of the short (maybe 2-3 km) downhill sections as I was trying to bunny hop over some road bumps, my chain fell off. Actually this was the only mechanical issue I had the whole weekend, so I was lucky! I put it back, no mess and I kept going. I overtook some old dudes and some young folks flew by me as a group but finally I made it up to Coll Formic, where I stopped for a moment to reward myself with a bag of gummy bears. :smile:

The descent was fast. I felt like I was pedalling as if I have 9 lives. All the way back to the sea. It was so smooth, long turns, no traffic, just breathtaking. It was disappointing again to look at the GPS at the end of the ride just to learn that what felt like jumping to warp in reality was 60km/h. I guess I need bigger gears next time!

Unfortunately like everything in life, my descent also came to its end and I was welcomed by the endless sea. Great view, but something bothered me already from a distance: those waves looked big. My fears quickly got confirmed as I got on the main road by it. The winds were crazy strong. Like really strong. I thought that the last section of my ride will be an easy flat piece, but instead I had almost 2 hours of what felt like a constant battle with Poseidon himself. The ironman training was not for nothing though, he tried to brake me, but let’s be realistic, he had no chance. Plus I had a gelato waiting for me with Ms New York, so I couldn’t be late.

I made it right on time, she literally opened the hostel door right in front of me sharp on the hour. I took a quick shower, returned the bike and a few minutes later we met in the living room. 
I’d like to say that this time I was fresh and fly, but those 170+ kms, plus my little fight in the end drained me so empty, that when we arrived to the famous gelato place, my stomach was just like: “wtf man are you kidding me, feed me with something proper.” and with shaking hands, I just dropped my ice cream right on the ground. :see-no-evil:
I felt myself so ashamed. I could see my ex-girlfriends judging look in my head. But Ms New York was just so cool about it, she ran back in to ask for a cup and spooned out a bit from hers and offered it to me. I was so surprised, she is so nice. And as she handed it over, she dropped it. :see_no_evil: :see_no_evil: :see_no_evil:
We were laughing really hard, she just got another cup, this time the mission was successful and we chatted for like 2 hours there out in the terrace. We talked about family, therapy, New York, relationships, social pressure to get married. The time was flying. At one point I suggested to go for dinner, we found a pretty nice tapas place around and continued there. I ate like… 8 plates of tapas and I think I was still in a caloric deficit by the end haha.
Then we walked back to the hostel, which was pretty empty at this point and we chatted again until after midnight. Since I was not in rush because I just wanted to go for a run and it was raining anyways, we made plans to have breakfast together the next morning, before she had to leave. 

Earphones back in, good night!
