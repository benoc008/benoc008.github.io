## Description

Running in Barcelona holds the same difficulties as cycling there. The amount of red lights make it more of an interval session to get out of the city. Unfortunately for me it was 5km from the inner city. As soon as I left the grid however I had nothing to slow me down except for some crazy steep hills and my heart rate.

The little trails up and around Tibidabo were quiet, even on a Sunday. The roads were nice, the gravel was nice, the trails were nice, and at the summit there was even a public restroom with drinking water. Nothing bad to say about this trail.

After breakfast I walked Ms New York to the metro station by the Sagrada Familia - they did make some progress on it in the last 5 years!
We agreed to keep in touch if we ever visit each other’s cities and said our good byes. I’m so glad we met, she was the gem of my vacation.

The forecast said sun for the afternoon, so I still had some time to spare. I went back to the hostel to pack my stuff and catch up on my messages and then I already got hungry again. So I headed back to the city to grab some food and a nice coffee before my long run.

As mentioned above, running in the city sucks. The trails however were breathtaking. The views to the entire city with the endless sea in the background never gets boring. 
Even though it was so steep at parts that I felt like I was breathing through all my body openings, I just couldn’t stop smiling. 

I even made a little video completely accidentally that ended with the view to the city+sea. Sorry for the image stabilisation - or the lack of it. Maybe I should get a new phone or even better: a camera?

After the run I just took a shower, had some vegan burgers and the famous Catalan cheese cake for dinner and got myself ready to go home early the next morning.

This is the wrap of my short, spontaneous but unforgettable first ever solo vacation. 

Until the next one! I already have something in mind. :hand_over_mouth:
