I've spent 3 beautiful days in and around Barcelona, full of cycling, running, good food, perfect weather and most surprisingly I even met someone really interesting and refreshing!

### Intro
Our Lord and Saviour, the one and only protector of the Holy Stock Price, the CEO has spoken to their moral employee and rewarded them with a free day off - the day that is technically an accounting mistake anyways, the Leap day. Well the one after that, making it a 3 day weekend for us.

Awesome, I thought, let's go cycling for 3 days! One issue though: it's raining  everywhere! :unamused:. It was already Wednesday night as I was desperately scrolling through the weather map of Switzerland and neighbours for options when I remembered that I can also just pack my stuff and fly away!

It looked pretty bad in the entirety of Europe, but I've seen two exceptions, two little points of happiness where the sun smiled through the clouds: one somewhere in the middle of Turkey and the other one - you guessed well - in Barcelona. I've never been to Turkey and though I'd like to visit sometime, that's probably a trip I would plan more thoroughly. And Barcelona, well, who doesn't like Barcelona? Nice weather, beautiful architecture, good food, cycling communities, what else do I need? Also, since I've been there before, I wouldn't feel the pressure to pay my due to the local cultural heritage. The Sagrada Familia is already my favourite church, let's jump in and discover the region this time on a bicycle!

### Planning

#### Flight
As I just wrote, I planned the trip about 20 hours before my flight. I booked it just after midnight - it will be perfect I thought - right after work, I can leave my laptop in the office and I can come back on Monday morning, directly to start the week ~~dead tired and full of holiday depression~~ well rested and productive! :grinning: 

#### Accommodation
This was a tricky one. I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford a hotel in Barcelona, but is this really what I want? What if I get lonely after spending the entire day on the bike alone anyways? What if my thoughts keep spiralling, locking me in an echo chamber? I've never been to a holiday alone before, so screw it, I thought, let's replace the comfort zone of a Hotel room with a bunk bed in Hostel with 11 other people1 what could go wrong?! #yolo. I booked the one that said "[Bed and Bike](https://www.barcelonabedandbike.com/en/home/)" on it, and as it was already 1am, I called it a successful holiday plan and fell asleep.

#### Bike rental
I knew about the free bike boxes in the Zurich airport, but I didn't have time nor wanted to bother packing my bike for a 3 day trip. I thought it will be easier and cheaper to rent one there, so I just grabbed my shoe and my garmin in the morning along with my regular + sports clothes and jammed them into my suitcase.
During lunch break I looked up the closest [rental](https://www.terrabiketours.com/) to the hostel, and reserved a Canyon Endurace something something with DI2. Like mine at home, but with DI2. The complications with it only came later. So far, so good.

### Arrival
As my main man, Murphy would predict, the beautiful sunny forecasted weather already turned into an evening rain. And as I was in 100% adventure mode at this point, I didn't want to roll up to the hostel in a taxi, I decided to take the bus to the city, like the locals, and just walk from there.
After about 20 minutes of walking in the rain I started to realise that either Barcelona grew a lot in the past 5 years or I was much smaller back then, but these precisely laid out grids are longer than I remembered. Anyways, I arrived quite a bit after midnight, so it was pretty quiet already. The guy at the reception showed me my bed and with that I had nothing else to do but sleep, to get rested for the adventures of the weekend!

#### 1st night
Lol I lied. Before sleeping I had to make my bed, which was on the top of a bunk bed. I also had to unpack my suitcase and get ready to sleep. Sounds easier than done, when 11 people are already sleeping in the dark room and the furniture resonates with the amplitude of a sonic blast to the lightest touch. 

So I just carefully took out my toothbrush, realised that I forgot to pack a sleeping T-shirt, packed my bags away from the corridor and went to clean myself up a bit. Making that bed with no noise is what I'm the 2nd most proud of in my life. (The guy sleeping below me might disagree.)  

Sleeping wasn't that easy however. I believe that the guy next to me had some kind of a skin condition where if he stopped scratching, it would spontaneously combust or something. Just in case he was doing it until 2am. Then he fell asleep and kept the motion going using his nasal cavity. 

Multiple mistakes were made that day with the planning, but the biggest one was me leaving my earplugs in the bottom of my suitcase. There was no way I could take that out without waking everyone up. It was around 4am when I realised that I could just use my noise cancelling earbuds! I knew where those were + I had to climb down anyways, because I had to pee by then. Perfect. Or so I thought. They were not powerful enough. I had to play the "White noise 10 hours" playlist on maximum volume to get me some sleep. At least I managed!

And from here on the story continues with Day1. :wink:
