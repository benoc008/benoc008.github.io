The day was Wednesday, the 1st of May, national holiday, so a perfect excuse to a 1 day getaway.

I knew that she has a road bike and that she did ride it before, but I was really not sure about her level, so when I started planning the route, I tried cautiously asking for some directions. 
Like, how long should the ride be, to which I got the answer of 4-5 hours. I really didn't feel much closer with the answer, I don't know how far or how much elevation she can ride in 4-5 hours. But I took it as a sign that she probably doesn't know either and tried planning something not too demanding.
I wanted to go to the hills of Jura first - simply because I've never been there, but other than an Ostrich farm, there doesn't seem to be anything there. 
I have to admit, the Ostriches seemed to be really interesting to me, but it would probably have been a terrible first date. Imagine telling that story to your besties.  

Anyways, luckily later she suggested Colmar, which on the contrast is an awesome first date location. Cute little romantic village in France, indeed really really close to Basel - and there are even trains, so worst case I knew we could just take the trains back!

I keep mentioning first date, but somehow I didn't quite manage to clarify that it is in fact a first date, and I wasn't 100% certain about her intentions either.
I was thinking of bringing a flower, but I already had to bring a bike, and well, she as well, I'm not sure how much fun it is to ride with a Rose all day. Maybe next time i'll try, but after long hesitation I ended up buying a little chocolate instead. That is anyways always useful on the bike.
So with these butterflies in my stomach I took the morning train to Basel to meet her on the train station and get the day started.

She was sweet, didn't look like a cyclist at all. She didn't even have a helmet - which I believe is not mandatory there, but still, I wouldn't even go shopping without that :see_no_evil:. But of course also no cycling pants or shoes, so it was a really quick giveaway that she was not a practicing cyclist.
Nothing wrong with that, everyone starts somewhere, and if you want to keep up with me, you'll get into it really quickly - i thought. (Lol what a dork, I'll never do this - probably she thought.)

So we were slowly riding out of the city, making our way to France, chatting, good weather, very nice time, I was enjoying it a lot, until about 3-4km in, when she went through a rock and I immediately heard a hissing noise.
She just had a flat. 

Later when I told this story to my friends Attila said: God himself placed that rock in front of her tires. :rofl:

I wasn't panicking, I presented calm and confident manliness, the ability to fix every situation and all that. So yea, I was prepared with 2 spare tubes and all the tools, so I quickly replaced it on the side of the road. And on her side, she was sweet, sitting by me, waiting really patiently. She said that she thought that was it, this is the end of the ride.  
I'm not sure if she said that because she secretly wanted the ride to end early, but in this case bad luck, because I fixed it in no time and we were on our way again.

The ride was 75k and we took only two little breaks, the first in the bar of a football field. I believe some junior teams were playing and locals took the excuse to drink wine next to the field.
I had a coke and refilled my bottles, good times. I mean the minutes we spent there chatting, not the bottle refilling, that was average at best.

I've been to these roads before but not actually to Colmar. With an ex girlfriend we did cycle to Strasbourg once, which basically is the same way, just a little further up. Funny, I remembered exactly the place where I wanted to take a toilet break and was closed (like back then) and the next place too where it was actually open.
I had mixed feelings, a bit of guilt for doing almost the same trip - but with another girl - and a bit of shame, feeling used and old, that I have all these memories already, instead of when I was first here, young and naive.
Anyways, apart from the these feelings eating me from the inside the break was again good. Maybe she sensed these feelings on me? I'll never know.

In Colmar we went to the inner city and parked the bikes somewhere there to then walk around in the city.
Before leaving I was really hesitant if I should bring changing clothes, I knew that we we will be walking in the city after all. 
On the other hand I didn't want to be the princess needing a changing room, so I decided to just wing it in my lycra, we are on a cycling trip after all.
So I only packed by lame looking little barefoot shoes, so that I can walk at least.
She on the other hand was looking just like a sporty girl, in her shorts and t-shirt :shrug:. So I guess I was still a dork.

I tried to radiate as much confidence as I could with my tiny dong showing through my tight pants and just simply enjoy the city.
We had some food and some nice walks and nice chats and all was good.

After a few hours we decided to take the train back to Basel, where we stayed by the river for a little longer for another drink. She showed me that part of the city and a nice bar, it all seemed to be great until that point. 

I had a good time, but did she? Stay tuned to find out!
