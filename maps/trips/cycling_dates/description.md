I wasn't really in the mood to start dating, but to my psychologist's and other friend's suggestion I pushed myself to socialize a little more. This is how I ended up signing up to Timeleft. 
The concept of the app is weird, they organise dinners for 6. The catch is: you don't know the other 5 people, nor the location.
There is a ~20 question survey at the beginning about interests and education and restaurant price ranges and then you are good to go.
It's always on Wednesday evening, the only thing that doesn't change is the time. On Wednesday morning the app will tell you where to go for the dinner and the nationality of the other 5, that's it. The rest you'll figure out there.

It's fun, I've joined I think a total of 5 times and I've met some interesting people there. I wouldn't say I made many friends, only 1, but that's still not bad stats and I've learnt a lot on the way.

I've also met K on one of these dinners. She had a kind smile and a sweet german accent that I had never thought I would ever enjoy until I met her. She came from Basel just for this (I wasn't surprised, I met people from St Gallen or Bern too, it seems to be quite popular and apparently all other swiss cities are dead boring :shrug:)
At some point during the dinner cycling came up as a topic (I guess I can't talk about anything else :sweat_smile:) and she mentioned that she always wanted to do cycling trips.

Say no more, I texted her right after the dinner to introduce her to the world of cycling trips - hoping that in exchange she will love me.
