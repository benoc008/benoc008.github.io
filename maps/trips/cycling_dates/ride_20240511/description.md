The Bar was pretty high after Colmar, and though I thought it was pretty fun, I really didn't see the enthusiasm from K, and I'm afraid the issue was not the cycling part.
She spent a couple of days in Ticino alone and asked me if I'd tag along for a day of cycling. I was really excited, took the train down early in the morning and we started the day with a coffee.

We started climbing as soon as we got out of the city of Locarno and everything went smooth, except for some weird noise coming out of her bike. I was a little bit nervous, I knew that she was kind of sporty [1] but the ride I planned (and she approved) was 70k+ with 1000m+ elevation. Definitely not a beginner ride. With a disintegrating bike I'd say a pretty hard one actually.
Her brakes were rubbing, the BB was rubbing, everything was rubbing and she couldn't switch in the front for some reason. I tried cleaning it up a bit on the side of the road, it got better and she also managed to shift (once lol) so we continued.

Luckily after the first bit the traffic was again really good and we even got the chance for a longer brake, as the road was closed due to some "road works", which meant that the road was closed but there was no works. Typical. Some people waited patiently: like 5 cars, 3-4 motorbikes and another ~5 cyclists, the other cyclists just ignored the roadblock and kept riding. 
The sign siad that the block is over in about 45 minutes, so we waited patiently and only kept moving afterwards, but it was a good opportunity to chat a bit more. 

She did really well and only stopped once, near the very top of the climb, at a steep part, I was honestly really surprised. There is no way I could have done that on my 2nd bike ride.

There was noting at the peek but a bit further down we found a nice little cafe with other german speaking cyclists around. Unfortunately the waiter didn't speak any german or english so we had to collect all our language skills to get some iced coffee. Which in the end we actually got. An espresso with an ice cube. :see_no_evil: At least she accepted our swiss franks (not the credit cards).

The descent was narrow and the road quality wasn't perfect. I enjoyed it, but felt it being a little sketchy due to the traffic from the opposite direction. I was a little bit afraid for her, didn't know if she enjoyed it or frightened for her life as I would be on my first such descent. But she wasn't and followed me surprisingly fast, we got down in no time.

(I know it sounds like as if I tried to kill her, taking her abroad to a huge climb to tire her and then send her down to the nothingness, but I promise, it wasn't my intention, I communicated as clearly as I could to prepare her to what was coming, she was consent. :sweat_smile:)

The second brake was in Cannobio, were we had a beautiful pizza and in another place a coffee, by the lake, clear blue skies, warm weather, what a beautiful day.
We didn't know yet but the hardest parts were still ahead of us. The road back was just flat, but so were here tires. Not sure what happened, she got them checked after the accident last time, but worry not - I said, and checked her tires. As they seemed to be fine, and we were so close, I just inflated them again and we kept going.
But unfortunately it wasn't working and just after 2-3kms they were flat again.
The road wasn't great, the typical italian motorway, busy with cars, not much space for the cyclists and all the debris from the road are tossed to the side where cyclists would go.
But we made a quick stop to replace the tire and after a few minutes we were back on the road, still on time before darkness and to catch the trains.

The train back was again an adventure. We could almost have made it to the same train (as she had to change in Zurich) but there wasn't enough bike places on them for the both of us.
She booked the ticket and then I couldn't. Eventually we decided to take 2 other trains that were faster and maybe more convenient to us, until! My train was cancelled/delayed and I took her spot on the other train haha! :D

We agreed that we had a great time and decided to next time meet somewhere without the bikes - so we won't be so sweaty and dirty. 
Very exciting!


[1]: Kind of sporty: She ran a ~1:50 half marathon the year before. When I mentioned this to my friends they got really mad at me, "how can I say 'Kind of sporty' to this, this is proper sporty, this is my PB after training for years!!" :sweat_smile"
